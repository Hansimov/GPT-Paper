## Strategies for unraveling the “black-box” of AI-based

### Model-based explanation
1. Support vector machine or random forests vs. deep learning
2. Supervised learning vs. weakly supervised learning vs. unsupervised learning
3. Textual explanation
   a. Image captioning
   b. Image captioning with visual explanation
4. Example-based explanation 
   a. Triplet network
   b. Prototypes

### Post hoc explanation
1. Visual explanation (saliency mapping, pathologist-in-the-loop)
   a. Backpropagation-based approaches
      Including class activation mapping (CAM) and gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM)
   b. Perturbation-based approaches
      Including Occlusion sensitivity map (OSM), local interpretable model-agnostic explannations (LIME)
   c. Multiple instance learning-based approaches
2. Textual explanation
   Testing with concept activation vectors (TCAV)
3. Example-based explanation
   a. Influence functions
   b. ...
