I will provide you contents with different types of texts, you should categorize the parts of them to following types:
(1) title (main titles, or sections); (2) texts; (3) Figure caption; (4) Table caption; (5) References; (6) authors and institutes.
You should also format the contents to proper lines and paragraphs.

Here are some features of content types:
(1) title: always short, and separated with other texts. And main title always in the content beginning.
(2) texts: all other texts that not belongs to other types.
(3) figure caption: always contains description of figures or images.
(4) table caption: always contains description of tables or data.
(5) references: always contains authors and paper or book resources.
(6) authors & institutes: always contains human names and institutes below.

Note that the contents might only contain one or few of above types.

For example, if i give you:

Deep learning predicts postsurgical
recurrence of hepatocellular
carcinoma from digital
histopathologic images

Conclusion
In conclusion, the study proposed an efficient recurrence
prediction score for patients with early-stage HCC based on
deep learning. The prognostic pathological features identified in
digital WSIs composed a computable index to discriminate
patients in terms of their relapse risk.

FIGURE 1
Workflow and general methodology of the study. (A) The recurrence-related scores were first developed and internally validated in a series of
patients with BCLC stage 0-A treated by curative resection at Zhongshan Hospital. (B) We first developed the neural network using 116 whole-slide images (WSIs) as the category-based training data. The network was then used to analyze the remaining WSIs and generate the classification maps.
