I will provide you contents with different types of texts, you should categorize the parts of them to following types:
(1) title; (2) body texts; (3) Figure caption; (4) Table caption; (5) References; (6) authors & institutes.
You should also format the contents to proper lines and paragraphs.

Here are some features of content types:
(1) title: always short, and separated with other texts.
(3) figure caption: always contains description of figures or images.
(4) table caption: always contains description of tables or data.
(5) references: always contains authors and paper or book resources.
(6) authors & institutes: always contains human names and institutes below.

Note that the contents might only contain one or few of above types.

For example, if i give you:
```
Conclusion
In conclusion, the study proposed an efficient recurrence
prediction score for patients with early-stage HCC based on
deep learning. The prognostic pathological features identified in
digital WSIs composed a computable index to discriminate
patients in terms of their relapse risk.
```

You should give:
```
