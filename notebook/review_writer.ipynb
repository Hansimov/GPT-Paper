First, this may because CT and MRI can be used as the basis for clinical treatment strategies for patients with liver cancer based on guidelines for liver cancer diagnosis. Moreover, ultrasound, as a screening method for patients at high risk of liver cancer, needs to be checked every six months. Therefore, the data volume of these three imaging methods has greatly increased, which has promoted the development of AI in liver cancer (37-39). Second, compared with MRI, CT has the advantages of fast inspection speed and cost-effectiveness, and is an indispensable and important imaging method in the diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer. Finally, although ultrasound is widely used in clinical practice, its image acquisition is seriously affected by the doctor’s operation technique and machine model, the resolution is low, and the processing is difficult. Therefore, it is used less often than CT. However, it is worth noting that contrast-enhanced ultrasound has now been included as a recommended imaging modality for the diagnosis of liver cancer (40, 41) and is also widely used in the development and prognostic evaluation of ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation. This suggests that we could pay attention to the important role of ultrasound in liver cancer clinics in future research.

Two categories of AI that have shown promise in liver imaging are radiomics (relying on classical ML) and DL systems (relying on CNNs) (Fig. 2A). Radiomics is a strongly supervised and expert-guided approach where hardcoded algorithms extract quantitative image features that are fed into an ML algorithm.°® In contrast, DL with a CNN constitutes an automatic feature extraction where the algorithm selflearns salient features and self-optimises parameters by running an input image through mathematical operations embedded in multiple layers.°°? Because both approaches aim to predict a pre-defined “ground truth,” they are considered supervised learning approaches. Herein, we review AI tools for liver imaging in segmentation, classification of disease severity and lesions, and outcome prediction. ',\n",

      "# Statement:\n",
      "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown significant promise in the management of liver cancer, however, several challenges still exist. One of the main issues is the need for structured data collection, sharing, and storage [12]. Another challenge is the high medical cost of genetic examination and the difficulty of realizing AI in multiomics research [8]. Additionally, the lack of research on AI-assisted decision-making for precision treatment methods adapted to specific patients is a limiting factor [7]. Furthermore, while AI has been beneficial in the diagnosis and management of liver diseases, further research and validation are required for future use [13]. Lastly, the adoption of coordinated research opportunities is essential to facilitate the development of many clinically useful tools, as working in isolation from AI and data scientists can hinder the growth of clinical medicine [5].\n",
