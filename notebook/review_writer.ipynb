application in the diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases, especially in China, which has one of the highest incidences of liver cancer compared to other countries the world.\\nIn addition, intelligent analysis of imaging data is the hotspot and focus of current research in this field.\\nHowever, combined with the current clinical difficulties such as accurate screening of early-stage liver cancer patients and high-risk patients, and selection of reasonable treatment decisions for advanced liver cancer patients, the use of AI for the fusion analysis of multiple types data in the process of diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer and multi-modal treatment decision-making for liver cancer are still relatively rare, and may become a future research trend.\\n\\nAs more and more researchers are interested in the use of AI in liver cancer, a large number of related studies have started being published.\\nFor example, reviews describing an overview of deep learning, convolutional neural networks and other AI technologies applications in liver cancer (20-22), reviews on the applications of AI on assisted imaging in diagnosis, prognosis and detection of liver

imaging.\\nHence, GI and liver specialists should be proud that our field sets the ground for AI development in medicine.\\n\\nStudies on the treatment and prognosis of liver cancer mainly focused on the survival of a specific surgical method (59-66), such as radiofrequency ablation, transarterial chemoembolization and etc.\\nReports have proven that the modern therapies integrate a variety of neoadjuvant and adjuvant strategies have achieved dramatic improvements in survival, especially for patients with advanced HCC (66, 67).\\nBut the division of the patient population, the choice of potentially disclosing novel biomarkers still are controversies and the decision-making of precision treatment methods adapted to the specific patients, AI can play a role in this, but related research has not yet been seen.\\n\\nWith the development of medical big data and computer technology, artificial intelligence (AI) based on machine learning and deep learning has been widely used in current medical research (3-6).\\nThrough self-learning, summary, and induction of data, it can produce an intelligent reasoning system and choose the optimal solution to guide clinical decision-making (7).\\nOriginal AI was based on traditional machine-learning methods, including support vector machine and random forest models, which all relied on human experience for learning and simple summary.\\nAs early as 2003, Hussain constructed a predictive system consisting of 12 genes, with Fisher’s linear classifier, for predicting early recurrence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (8).\\nDuring this period, most studies have focused on simple analyses of data, such as genes and molecules (9-11).\\nWith the standardization of imaging diagnosis and its important role in the clinical diagnosis of liver cancer, AI research based on imaging has emerged by extracting high-throughput features that cannot be detected and defined by human eyes from large-scale image data to establish an intelligent decision -making model to assist clinical decisionmaking (12, 13).\\nIn particular, deep learning based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has promoted progress in liver cancer research (14-19).\\n\\nAnother rapidly growing area of research is focused on improved characterisation of indeterminate liver lesions.\\nIn clinical practice, when an abdominal ultrasound shows a new liver lesion, a patient is typically referred for further imaging, with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI.\\nBased on the fulfilment of specific radiologic criteria, certain liver lesions may be considered as having pathognomonic features of HCC, and thus do not require liver biopsy for further histological confirmation.\\nHowever, liver nodules imaged by CT or MRI often demonstrate indeterminate features, for which current recommendations include either liver biopsy or close interval follow-up with serial imaging.”° This practice is sub-optimal, resulting in numerous imaging studies, patient stress, and the potential for delayed diagnoses of liver cancer.\\nFor this reason, a growing body of recent literature has explored AI approaches to improve risk stratification of indeterminate liver lesions, to facilitate earlier and more accurate detection of HCC.\\n\\nRegarding data type, studies of AI in liver cancer started from the simple data modeling of genetic or molecular data (9-11).\\nWith the development of medical imaging, research on medical imaging has been gradually increasing.\\nCT, ultrasound, and MRI are the top three most used data types.\\nFirst, this may because CT and MRI can be used as the basis for clinical treatment strategies for patients with liver cancer based on guidelines for liver cancer diagnosis.\\nMoreover, ultrasound, as a screening method for patients at high risk of liver cancer, needs to be checked every six months.\\nTherefore, the data volume of these three imaging methods has greatly increased, which has promoted the development of AI in liver cancer (37-39).\\nSecond, compared with MRI, CT has the advantages of fast inspection speed and cost-effectiveness, and is an indispensable and important imaging method in the diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer.\\nFinally, although ultrasound is widely used in clinical practice, its image acquisition is seriously affected by the doctor’s operation technique and machine model, the resolution is low, and the processing is difficult.\\nTherefore, it is used less often than CT.\\nHowever, it is worth noting that contrast-enhanced ultrasound has now been included as a recommended imaging modality for the diagnosis of liver cancer (40, 41) and is also widely used in the development and prognostic evaluation of ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation.\\nThis suggests that we could pay attention to the important role of ultrasound in liver cancer clinics in future research.\\nAt the same time, few studies used pathological, genetic, and other clinical data (42-44).\\nThe main reason may be that the medical cost of genetic examination is high and the realization of AI in multiomics research is difficult.\\n\\nPrevious meta-analyses and literature reviews focused on the applications of specific technologies in liver cancer or the development status of specific liver disease (22-29), such as reviewing studies on AI on assisted imaging in the diagnosis, prognosis and detection of liver cancer, or explaining the latest research, limitations, and future development trends of AI in a\\n\\nThe analysis of the global trend of publications and citations and productive countries/regions is mainly to comprehensively understand the development trends of AI on liver cancer from beginning to end.\\nThe analysis of institutions, authors, and co-cited authors can quantitatively describe the strength of the cooperation between authors and institutions (30-32).\\nAdditionally, the analysis of top journals can analyze the level of cooperation and relationships in the concentrated fields of journals, which is beneficial to cross field cooperation in research (32).\\nIn particular, cluster co-occurrence analysis of keywords from different perspectives such as disease, data type, clinical goals, and clinical methods can help us understand the main topics and research trends in the current field of AI in liver cancer field.\\n\\nSince immune therapy has pioneered a new era of antitumoral systematic treatment [34], the expression of immune checkpoint molecules has been great significance to the prognosis of liver cancer [35].\\n\\nObjective: To provide the current research progress, hotspots, and emerging trends for Al in liver cancer, we have compiled a relative comprehensive and quantitative report on the research of liver disease using artificial intelligence by employing bibliometrics in this study.\\n\\nDue to the broad heterogeneity in risk factors for HCC and the lack of established strategies for prediction or prognostication, AI has recently emerged as a unique opportunity to improve the full spectrum of HCC clinical care.\\n\\nLiver cancer is an extremely aggressive malignant tumor, ranking 7\" in incidence and 4\" in mortality worldwide.\\nStudies have revealed that liver cancer has a high recurrence rate and low recovery rate, especially after the middle and late stages, and the 5-year survival rate of liver cancer is only 5-30% (1, 2).\\nTherefore, it has become a global health problem.\\nDespite advances in diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer, including improved diagnostic imaging accuracy and improved survival after neoadjuvant or conversion therapy, but it is limited.\\nAccurate screening of early-stage liver cancer patients and high-risk patients, and rational treatment decisions for patients with advanced stage liver cancer are of great significance for improving the quality of life of patients.\\n\\nProspective studies are needed to fully demonstrate the potential of AI to improve the clinical care of patients with HCC.\\nIn other medical areas, several Al-based randomised clinical trials have already been conducted.\\nAs such, in endoscopy, numerous randomised clinical trials have evaluated the impact of computer-aided systems on physicians’ performance in diagnosing intestinal adenoma or indicating blind spots of colonoscopy.’*°° The need to incorporate these new developments prompted the research community to extend the widely used SPIRIT and CONSORT guidelines for the use of Al methods in

       "\"Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies have made great strides in automatically quantifying pathological patterns based on digital histological slides [18].\\nWith the integration of digital slides into the pathology workflow, advanced algorithms and computeraided techniques expand and reinforce their utilization in tumor diagnosis, prognostic prediction and therapy targeting, which enable the interpretation of information beyond human limits and ultimately, improve patient management [19-21].\\nFor HCC, survival indicators after liver resection were proposed based on weakly supervised deep learning methods, exhibiting high accuracy [22, 23].\\nWith largely uncovered invisible information available from HCC histology, further integration of recurrence prediction models and AI algorithms in transplant patients suffering from HCC deserve to be explored.\\nMoreover, a comprehensive research on correlation between HCC histological structures and prognosis is urgently needed.\\n\\nAI is an upcoming promising technology that is rapidly becoming an essential part of patient management.\\nApplications of AI have expanded in all branches of medicines, especially endoscopy and hepatology.\\nThe conglomeration of data which can be clinical/laboratory, multi-omics, natural language processing (NLP) and Image recognition (both radiology-based and pathology-based) has contributed to the prediction of fibrosis, classification of liver masses and prediction of treatment response and transplant outcomes.\\n’® In this review the majority of studies mentioned focussed on diagnosis part.\\nThere are very few studies that help to predict treatment response, post-liver transplant response, and prediction of hepatotoxicity in newer drug development and more studies are needed.\\nAI also helps for realtime biomonitoring, by identification of patients at high risk of clinical decompensation and hospital admission, so that timely intervention can be done for high-risk patients.\\nWith the increasing advancement of image capture and storage, AI will bring striking changes to the diagnosis of various liver diseases with the ‘big data’ being available.\\nHowever, there are many hurdles to overcome, which researchers will do in the near future using validation studies and molecular research.\\nIt is expected that gastroenterology and hepatology will be one of the first areas in medicine to introduce AI tools on a wide-scale basis, due to its inherent reliance on endoscopic and radiological imaging.\\nHence, GI and liver specialists should be proud that our field sets the ground for AI development in medicine.\\n\\nThis study used bibliometrics to conduct an in-depth analysis of the published literature on AI in liver cancer.\\nThe results showed that AI has undergone rapid development and has a wide application in the diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases, especially in China, which has one of the highest incidences of liver cancer compared to other countries the world.\\nIn addition, intelligent analysis of imaging data is the hotspot and focus of current research in this field.\\nHowever, combined with the current clinical difficulties such as accurate screening of early-stage liver cancer patients and high-risk patients, and selection of reasonable treatment decisions for advanced liver cancer patients, the use of AI for the fusion analysis of multiple types data in the process of diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer and multi-modal treatment decision-making for liver cancer are still relatively rare, and may become a future research trend.\\n\\nWith the development of medical big data and computer technology, artificial intelligence (AI) based on machine learning and deep learning has been widely used in current medical research (3-6).\\nThrough self-learning, summary, and induction of data, it can produce an intelligent reasoning system and choose the optimal solution to guide clinical decision-making (7).\\nOriginal AI was based on traditional machine-learning methods, including support vector machine and random forest models, which all relied on human experience for learning and simple summary.\\nAs early as 2003, Hussain constructed a predictive system consisting of 12 genes, with Fisher’s linear classifier, for predicting early recurrence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (8).\\nDuring this period, most studies have focused on simple analyses of data, such as genes and molecules (9-11).\\nWith the standardization of imaging diagnosis and its important role in the clinical diagnosis of liver cancer, AI research based on imaging has emerged by extracting high-throughput features that cannot be detected and defined by human eyes from large-scale image data to establish an intelligent decision -making model to assist clinical decisionmaking (12, 13).\\nIn particular, deep learning based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has promoted progress in liver cancer research (14-19).\\n\\nOwing to the broad heterogeneity in HCC risk factors and pathogenesis, established strategies for prediction and prognostication are still limited.\\nRecently, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a unique opportunity to improve the full spectrum of HCC clinical care, by: i) improving the prediction of future HCC risk in patients with established liver disease; ii) improving the accuracy of HCC\\n\\nAnother rapidly growing area of research is focused on improved characterisation of indeterminate liver lesions.\\nIn clinical practice, when an abdominal ultrasound shows a new liver lesion, a patient is typically referred for further imaging, with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI.\\nBased on the fulfilment of specific radiologic criteria, certain liver lesions may be considered as having pathognomonic features of HCC, and thus do not require liver biopsy for further histological confirmation.\\nHowever, liver nodules imaged by CT or MRI often demonstrate indeterminate features, for which current recommendations include either liver biopsy or close interval follow-up with serial imaging.”° This practice is sub-optimal, resulting in numerous imaging studies, patient stress, and the potential for delayed diagnoses of liver cancer.\\nFor this reason, a growing body of recent literature has explored AI approaches to improve risk stratification of indeterminate liver lesions, to facilitate earlier and more accurate detection of HCC.\\n\\nTherefore, we aimed to quantitatively analyze existing studies involving AI in liver cancer using bibliometrics to provide the current research progress, hotspots, and emerging trends for AI in liver cancer which may help researchers better understand grasp future research interest.\\nInformation was collated regarding countries/regions, institutions, authors, and journals with the highest citations and publications and keywords.\\n\\nStudies on the treatment and prognosis of liver cancer mainly focused on the survival of a specific surgical method (59-66), such as radiofrequency ablation, transarterial chemoembolization and etc.\\nReports have proven that the modern therapies integrate a variety of neoadjuvant and adjuvant strategies have achieved dramatic improvements in survival, especially for patients with advanced HCC (66, 67).\\nBut the division of the patient population, the choice of potentially disclosing novel biomarkers still are controversies and the decision-making of precision treatment methods adapted to the specific patients, AI can play a role in this, but related research has not yet been seen.\\n\\nAs more and more researchers are interested in the use of AI in liver cancer, a large number of related studies have started being published.\\nFor example, reviews describing an overview of deep learning, convolutional neural networks and other AI technologies applications in liver cancer (20-22), reviews on the applications of AI on assisted imaging in diagnosis, prognosis and detection of liver cancer (23-25), and explained the latest research, on limitations and future development trends of AI have all been recently published.\\nHowever, current reviews may be unable to explore grasp the latest research trends and hotspots in this field because of lack of a large number of publications.\\nMeanwhile, there is a lack of quantitative analysis of all\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a mathematical process of computer mediating designing of algorithms to support human intelligence.\\nAI in hepatology has shown tremendous promise to plan appropriate management and hence improve treatment outcomes.\\nThe field of AI is in a very early phase with limited clinical use.\\nAI tools such as machine learning, deep learning, and ‘big data’ are in a continuous phase of evolution, presently being applied for clinical and basic research.\\nIn this review, we have summarized various AI applications in hepatology, the pitfalls and AI's future implications.\\nDifferent AI models and algorithms are under study using clinical, laboratory, endoscopic and imaging parameters to diagnose and manage liver diseases and mass lesions.\\nAI has helped to reduce human errors and improve treatment protocols.\\nFurther research and validation are required for future use of AI in hepatology.\\n(J Ciin Exp HepaTor 2023;13:149-161)\\n\\nPatients with liver disease, particularly those with liver cancer, undergo multiple imaging studies to establish a diagnosis, preoperatively plan interventions, and monitor response to therapy (Table S2).\\nEach of these imaging studies contain numerous data points that could be potentially analysed to improve predictions.\\nHowever, there is a formidable challenge in transforming this burden of clinical and imaging data into something of clinical value.\\n\\nRegarding data type, studies of AI in liver cancer started from the simple data modeling of genetic or molecular data (9-11).\\nWith the development of medical imaging, research on medical imaging has been gradually increasing.\\nCT, ultrasound, and MRI are the top three most used data types.\\nFirst, this may because CT and MRI can be used as the basis for clinical treatment strategies for patients with liver cancer based on guidelines for liver cancer diagnosis.\\nMoreover, ultrasound, as a screening method for patients at high risk of liver cancer, needs to be checked every six months.\\nTherefore, the data volume of these three imaging methods has greatly increased, which has promoted the development of AI in liver cancer (37-39).\\nSecond, compared with MRI, CT has the advantages of fast inspection speed and cost-effectiveness, and is an indispensable and important imaging method in the diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer.\\nFinally, although ultrasound is widely used in clinical practice, its image acquisition is seriously affected by the doctor’s operation technique and machine model, the resolution is low, and the processing is difficult.\\nTherefore, it is used less often than CT.\\nHowever, it is worth noting that contrast-enhanced ultrasound has now been included as a recommended imaging modality for the diagnosis of liver cancer (40, 41) and is also widely used in the development and prognostic evaluation of ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation.\\nThis suggests that we could pay attention to the important role of ultrasound in liver cancer clinics in future research.\\nAt the same time, few studies used pathological, genetic, and other clinical data (42-44).\\nThe main reason may be that the medical cost of genetic examination is high and the realization of AI in multiomics research is difficult.\\n\\nThe analysis of the global trend of publications and citations and productive countries/regions is mainly to comprehensively understand the development trends of AI on liver cancer from beginning to end.\\nThe analysis of institutions, authors, and co-cited authors can quantitatively describe the strength of the cooperation between authors and institutions (30-32).\\nAdditionally, the analysis of top journals can analyze the level of cooperation and relationships in the concentrated fields of journals, which is beneficial to cross field cooperation in research (32).\\nIn particular, cluster co-occurrence analysis of keywords from different perspectives such as disease, data type, clinical goals, and clinical methods can help us understand the main topics and research trends in the current field of AI in liver cancer field.\\n\\nTo facilitate transformation of imaging data into clinically accessible information, Al may derive predictions in a more personalised fashion.\\nTwo categories of AI that have shown promise in liver imaging are radiomics (relying on classical ML) and DL systems (relying on CNNs) (Fig.\\n2A).\\nRadiomics is a strongly supervised and expert-guided approach where hardcoded algorithms extract quantitative image features that are fed into an ML algorithm.°® In contrast, DL with a CNN constitutes an automatic feature extraction where the algorithm selflearns salient features and self-optimises parameters by running an input image through mathematical operations embedded in multiple layers.°°?\\nBecause both approaches aim to predict a pre-defined “ground truth,” they are considered supervised learning approaches.\\nHerein, we review AI tools for liver imaging in segmentation, classification of disease severity and lesions, and outcome prediction.\\n\\nIt is hoped that AI will profoundly change the way we care for patients with HCC.\\nAlthough significant progress has been made during the last decade, improvements in HCC risk prediction, diagnosis and response prediction are still critically needed.\\nSeveral challenges remain to fully implement such technologies in clinical practice, including the need to develop robust approaches for structured data collection, sharing and storage, and the need to\\n\\nWhile these concepts are still hypothetical, it will be important to integrate Al-based algorithms into current and future clinical trials, in order to prove that they are valuable tools to predict responses to first-line therapy and to predict early progression.\\nImplementing these steps will depend on access to biological samples and clinical data within large clinical trials, and will require acceptance of these concepts and further that these data are made accessible to the clinician scientists who are contributing patients to these trials.\\nTo that end, collaborative networks based on trust and united in the collective aim of improving patient outcomes need to be implemented not only between clinicians but also with industry.\\nNevertheless, it is paramount for any model developed and trained within the framework of a clinical trial to be thoroughly validated in diverse, real-world patient populations before clinical implementation, to address possible biases introduced by the trial’s inclusion criteria.\\nMoreover, Al-based algorithms and any resultant clinical tools must also be constructed with appropriate stakeholder engagement and oversight, to ensure that validated algorithms are standardised according to protocol and that they are used in the correct clinical contexts, and further that data output is interpreted properly to maximise clinical benefit.\\nCorrectly interpretating data output from an Al-based clinical tool will in turn require appropriate training and awareness, both amongst the public and clinical providers.\\n\\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the leading causes of cancer incidence and death.\\nDespite decades of research and development of new treatment options, the overall outcomes of patients with HCC continue to remain poor.\\nThere are areas of unmet need in risk prediction, early diagnosis, accurate prognostication, and individualized treatments for patients with HCC.\\nRecent years have seen an explosive growth in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in medical research, with the field of HCC being no exception.\\nAmong the various AI-based machine learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms are considered state-of-the-art techniques for handling and processing complex multimodal data ranging from routine clinical variables to high-resolution medical images.\\nThis article will provide a comprehensive review of the recently published studies that have applied deep learning for risk prediction, diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment planning for patients with HCC.\\n\\nIt has been posited that improved HCC risk prediction models leveraging AI techniques could be used to personalise HCC surveillance strategies by improving risk stratification of patients with chronic liver disease.\\nFor example, Ioannou and colleagues found that targeting patients with the uppermost 51% of their NN-derived HCC risk score would include 80% of patients who would develop HCC within the subsequent 3 years.° Such an approach could be useful in resource-limited settings that do not have sufficient capacity for regular HCC surveillance in all at-risk patients.\\nHowever, to date, the clinical utility of this and other Al-based scores for predicting risk of HCC is unclear, particularly as these data have limited generalisability, given their reliance on the size and diversity of the training dataset.\\n\\nIn this quantitative study, in order to systematically and quantitatively analyze the research status of AI in liver cancer, and explore the future research trends and hotspots in this field, we used a bibliometrics method to analyze the current research status of AI in liver cancer in terms of publication and citation trends, countries/ regions and institutions, authors and co-cited authors, journals, cited references and co-citation references, and keywords.\\nUltimately, 1724 articles focusing on Al in liver cancer were collected from the WoSCC database and analyzed.\\n\\nA growing body of research has applied AI approaches to improve HCC risk prediction, and to more accurately detect and risk stratify existing HCC tumours, based on EHR data, radiomics approaches, and molecular or histopathological biomarkers.\""

      "Statement: \n",
      "\n",
      "Model-based explanation in artificial intelligence (AI) refers to models that are simple enough to be understood yet sophisticated enough to fit a relationship between input and output. These include traditional machine learning models such as support vector machine and random forests. However, deep learning (DL) methods are often considered 'black-box' models due to their complexity, making it difficult to understand the processing of data. This has raised ethical challenges and concerns about misdiagnosis, racial bias, and generalizability. \n",
      "\n",
      "To address these issues, explainable AI (XAI) techniques have been developed to improve the interpretability of DL models. This includes the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) frameworks, which provide insight into the inner workings of the 'black box' by producing quantitative visualizations of how model predictions are calculated. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, the challenge remains that as models increase in complexity, they lose interpretability. Therefore, there is a need for model-based explanations that enforce the use of a limited amount of features or enforce a human to be able to internally reason about the model's decision making. This is particularly important in the field of medical research, where AI and DL have been widely used to guide clinical decision-making. \n",
      "\n",
      "While model-based explanation is by definition model-specific, not all model-specific explanations are model-based. Some post hoc saliency mapping techniques are specific to a certain class of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but are not model-based explanation methods. \n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while traditional machine learning models like support vector machine and random forests have been used in the early stages of research, the advent of deep learning has brought about new challenges in terms of model interpretability. This has led to the development of explainable AI techniques, but the need for model-based explanations that are simple, interpretable, and able to capture the complexity of these models remains.\n",

      "陈述：\n",
      "\n",
      "在人工智能（AI）中，基于模型的解释指的是足够简单以被理解，但足够复杂以适应输入和输出之间关系的模型。这包括传统的机器学习模型，如支持向量机和随机森林。然而，深度学习（DL）方法通常被认为是“黑匣子”模型，因为其复杂性使人难以理解数据的处理过程。这引发了伦理挑战和对误诊、种族偏见和泛化能力的担忧。\n",
      "\n",
      "为了解决这些问题，已经开发了可解释的AI（XAI）技术，以提高DL模型的可解释性。这包括局部可解释的模型无关解释（LIME）和SHapley加法解释（SHAP）框架，它们通过生成定量可视化来提供对“黑匣子”的内部工作原理的洞察，展示了模型预测如何计算。\n",
      "\n",
      "然而，挑战仍然存在，随着模型复杂性的增加，它们失去了可解释性。因此，有必要提供基于模型的解释，以强制使用有限数量的特征或强制人类能够内部推理模型的决策过程。这在医学研究领域尤为重要，AI和DL已广泛用于指导临床决策。\n",
      "\n",
      "虽然基于模型的解释在定义上是针对特定模型的，但并非所有特定模型的解释都是基于模型的。一些事后显著性映射技术特定于某一类卷积神经网络（CNNs），但不属于基于模型的解释方法。\n",
      "\n",
      "总之，传统的机器学习模型如支持向量机和随机森林已经在研究的早期阶段使用，深度学习的出现带来了模型可解释性方面的新挑战。这导致了可解释AI技术的发展，但仍然需要简单、可解释且能够捕捉这些模型复杂性的基于模型的解释。\n",
