      "# Statement:\n",
      "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown significant promise in the management of liver cancer, however, several challenges still exist. One of the main issues is the need for structured data collection, sharing, and storage [12]. Another challenge is the high medical cost of genetic examination and the difficulty of realizing AI in multiomics research [8]. Additionally, the lack of research on AI-assisted decision-making for precision treatment methods adapted to specific patients is a limiting factor [7]. Furthermore, while AI has been beneficial in the diagnosis and management of liver diseases, further research and validation are required for future use [13]. Lastly, the adoption of coordinated research opportunities is essential to facilitate the development of many clinically useful tools, as working in isolation from AI and data scientists can hinder the growth of clinical medicine [5].\n",

      "人工智能（AI）在肝癌管理方面表现出显著的潜力，然而，仍然存在一些挑战。其中一个主要问题是需要进行结构化数据的收集、共享和存储[12]。另一个挑战是基因检查的高医疗成本和在多组学研究中实现AI的困难[8]。此外，缺乏针对特定患者适应的精准治疗方法的AI辅助决策的研究是一个限制因素[7]。此外，虽然AI在肝疾病的诊断和管理方面已经有益，但未来需要进一步的研究和验证[13]。最后，采用协同研究机会对于促进许多临床有用工具的发展至关重要，因为与AI和数据科学家孤立工作可能会阻碍临床医学的发展[5]。\n",
