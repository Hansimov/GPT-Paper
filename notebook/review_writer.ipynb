      "Statement: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown significant progress in the clinical management and prognostication of liver cancer. The integration of AI in liver cancer research, particularly in China which has one of the highest incidences of liver cancer, has been rapidly developing. AI applications have expanded in all branches of medicine, especially endoscopy and hepatology, contributing to the prediction of fibrosis, classification of liver masses, and prediction of treatment response and transplant outcomes. Intelligent analysis of imaging data has become a research hotspot, with AI methodologies making strides in quantifying pathological patterns based on digital histological slides. This approach has improved patient management by enabling the interpretation of information beyond human limits. AI also helps in real-time biomonitoring, identifying patients at high risk of clinical decompensation and hospital admission for timely intervention. However, the use of AI for the fusion analysis of multiple types of data in the diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer and multi-modal treatment decision-making for liver cancer are still relatively rare. There is also an urgent need for comprehensive research on the correlation between liver cancer histological structures and prognosis. Despite the challenges, AI is expected to bring striking changes to the diagnosis of various liver diseases with the availability of 'big data'. AI has also been used in the prediction of future liver cancer risk in patients with established liver disease, improving the accuracy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis. With the development of medical big data and computer technology, AI based on machine learning and deep learning has been widely used in current medical research, guiding clinical decision-making. However, more studies are needed to fully demonstrate the potential of AI to improve the clinical care of patients with HCC.\n",

topics and research trends in the current field of AI in liver cancer field.\\n\\nTo facilitate transformation of imaging data into clinically accessible information, Al may derive predictions in a more personalised fashion.\\nTwo categories of AI that have shown promise in liver imaging are radiomics (relying on classical ML) and DL systems (relying on CNNs) (Fig.\\n2A).\\nRadiomics is a strongly supervised and expert-guided approach where hardcoded algorithms extract quantitative image features that are fed into an ML algorithm.°® In contrast, DL with a CNN constitutes an automatic feature extraction where the algorithm selflearns salient features and self-optimises parameters by running an input image through mathematical operations embedded in multiple layers.°°?\\nBecause both approaches aim to predict a pre-defined “ground truth,” they are considered supervised learning approaches.\\nHerein, we review AI tools for liver imaging in segmentation, classification of disease severity and lesions, and outcome prediction.\\n\\nIt is hoped that AI will profoundly change the way we care for patients with HCC.\\nAlthough significant progress has been made during the last decade, improvements in HCC risk prediction, diagnosis and response prediction are still critically needed.\\nSeveral challenges remain to fully implement such technologies in clinical practice, including the need to develop robust approaches for structured data collection, sharing and storage, and the need to\\n\\nWhile these concepts are still hypothetical, it will be important to integrate Al-based algorithms into current and future clinical trials, in order to prove that they are valuable tools to predict responses to first-line therapy and to predict early progression.\\nImplementing these steps will depend on access to biological samples and clinical data within large clinical trials, and will require acceptance of these concepts and further that these data are made accessible to the clinician scientists who are contributing patients to these trials.\\nTo that end, collaborative networks based on trust and united in the collective aim of improving patient outcomes need to be implemented not only between clinicians but also with industry.\\nNevertheless, it is paramount for any model developed and trained within the framework of a clinical trial to be thoroughly validated in diverse, real-world patient populations before clinical implementation, to address possible biases introduced by the trial’s inclusion criteria.\\nMoreover, Al-based algorithms and any resultant clinical tools must also be constructed with appropriate stakeholder engagement and oversight, to ensure that validated algorithms are standardised according to protocol and that they are used in the correct clinical contexts, and further that data output is interpreted properly to maximise clinical benefit.\\nCorrectly interpretating data output from an Al-based clinical tool will in turn require appropriate training and awareness, both amongst the public and clinical providers.\\n\\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the leading causes of cancer incidence and death.\\nDespite decades of research and development of new treatment options, the overall outcomes of patients with HCC continue to remain poor.\\nThere are areas of unmet need in risk prediction, early diagnosis, accurate prognostication, and individualized treatments for patients with HCC.\\nRecent years have seen an explosive growth in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in medical research, with the field of HCC being no exception.\\nAmong the various AI-based machine learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms are considered state-of-the-art techniques for handling and processing complex multimodal data ranging from routine clinical variables to high-resolution medical images.\\nThis article will provide a comprehensive review of the recently published studies that have applied deep learning for risk prediction, diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment planning for patients with HCC.\\n\\nIt has been posited that improved HCC risk prediction models leveraging AI techniques could be used to personalise HCC surveillance strategies by improving risk stratification of patients with chronic liver disease.\\nFor example, Ioannou and colleagues found that targeting patients with the uppermost 51% of their NN-derived HCC risk score would include 80% of patients who would develop HCC within the subsequent 3 years.° Such an approach could be useful in resource-limited settings that do not have sufficient capacity for regular HCC surveillance in all at-risk patients.\\nHowever, to date, the clinical utility of this and other Al-based scores for predicting risk of HCC is unclear, particularly as these data have limited generalisability, given their reliance on the size and diversity of the training dataset.\\n\\nIn this quantitative study, in order to systematically and quantitatively analyze the research status of AI in liver cancer, and explore the future research trends and hotspots in this field, we used a bibliometrics method to analyze the current research status of AI in liver cancer in terms of publication and citation trends, countries/ regions and institutions, authors and co-cited authors, journals, cited references and co-citation references, and keywords.\\nUltimately, 1724 articles focusing on Al in liver cancer were collected from the WoSCC database and analyzed.\\n\\nA growing body of research has applied AI approaches to improve HCC risk prediction, and to more accurately detect and risk stratify existing HCC tumours, based on EHR data, radiomics approaches, and molecular or histopathological

      "Statement: Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies have significantly contributed to the clinical management of liver cancer. AI has been integrated into the pathology workflow, aiding in tumor diagnosis, prognostic prediction, and therapy targeting. In particular, for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), survival indicators after liver resection have been proposed based on weakly supervised deep learning methods. AI has also been applied in predicting treatment response and transplant outcomes in hepatology. However, more studies are needed to further explore these areas. \n",
      "\n",
      "AI has also been used for real-time biomonitoring, identifying patients at high risk of clinical decompensation and hospital admission, allowing for timely intervention. The integration of AI in hepatology is still in its early phase, with ongoing research and validation required for its future use. \n",
      "\n",
      "The use of AI in liver cancer has been widely explored, with a focus on the diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases. AI research based on imaging has emerged, extracting high-throughput features from large-scale image data to establish an intelligent decision-making model. AI has shown promise in liver imaging, particularly in segmentation, classification of disease severity and lesions, and outcome prediction. \n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the significant progress made, improvements in HCC risk prediction, diagnosis, and response prediction are still critically needed. AI-based algorithms and resultant clinical tools must be thoroughly validated in diverse, real-world patient populations before clinical implementation. Overall, AI has shown tremendous promise in the clinical management of liver cancer. However, further research is needed to fully implement such technologies in clinical practice.\n",

      "Statement: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has seen rapid development and wide application in the diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases, particularly liver cancer. A significant focus of current research is the intelligent analysis of imaging data, such as CT, ultrasound, and MRI scans. However, the use of AI in the fusion analysis of multiple types of data in the diagnosis and treatment process of liver cancer is still relatively rare. The integration of digital slides into the pathology workflow has enabled the interpretation of information beyond human limits, improving patient management. Still, the \"black-box\" nature of specific Deep Learning (DL) methods makes it challenging to understand the data processing, which can inhibit the identification of potential confounding variables. Explainable AI (XAI) frameworks such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) aim to provide insight into the inner workings of the \"black box\", transforming complicated Machine Learning (ML) models into easily understandable charts and interpretable sets of rules. This facilitates the deployment of such models in routine clinical workflows. Despite this, there are several key issues to address before DL-based AI models can be universally implemented in real-world clinical practice settings. This includes the interpretability of the DL models and the generalizability of the individual DL algorithms. Furthermore, AI models are often not publicly available, limiting external validation. The future of AI in liver cancer research looks promising, with the expectation of overcoming current hurdles through validation studies and molecular research.\n",

      "Topic: Textual explanation of Strategies for unraveling the “black-box” of AI-based pathological analysis of liver cancer\n",
      "Statement: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been increasingly utilized in the diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer, particularly in China. The intelligent analysis of imaging data in liver cancer research is a current hot topic. However, the use of AI for fusion analysis of multiple types of data in liver cancer diagnosis and treatment is still relatively rare. AI technologies such as radiomics and deep learning systems have shown promise in liver imaging, aiding in disease severity classification, lesion segmentation, and outcome prediction. However, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning, are often viewed as a “black box” due to their complex data processing layers. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are being developed to make these models more interpretable and transparent. AI also has potential in improving the consistency and quality of information extracted from tissue, which could help in clinical decision making. However, there are concerns about the generalizability and interpretability of AI models, and the potential for bias in their development. Despite these challenges, AI is expected to play a significant role in the future of liver cancer research and treatment.\n",

      "陈述：人工智能（AI）在肝癌的诊断和治疗中的应用逐渐增多，尤其在中国。在肝癌研究中，智能分析影像数据是当前热门话题。然而，利用AI进行肝癌诊断和治疗中多种数据类型的融合分析仍相对罕见。AI技术，如放射学和深度学习系统，在肝脏影像方面显示出潜力，有助于疾病严重程度分类、病变分割和结果预测。然而，卷积神经网络（CNNs），一种深度学习类型，由于其复杂的数据处理层，常被视为“黑匣子”。可解释的人工智能（XAI）技术正在发展中，以使这些模型更具解释性和透明性。AI还有潜力改善从组织中提取的信息的一致性和质量，这有助于临床决策。然而，人们对AI模型的泛化能力和解释性，以及其开发中潜在的偏见存在担忧。尽管存在这些挑战，但预计AI将在肝癌研究和治疗的未来发挥重要作用。\n"
