Two categories of AI that have shown\npromise in liver imaging are radiomics (relying on classical ML)\nand DL systems (relying on CNNs) (Fig. 2A). Radiomics is a\nstrongly supervised and expert-guided approach where hard-\ncoded algorithms extract quantitative image features that are\nfed into an ML algorithm.°® In contrast, DL with a CNN consti-\ntutes an automatic feature extraction where the algorithm self-\nlearns salient features and self-optimises parameters by\nrunning an input image through mathematical operations\nembedded in multiple layers.°°? Because both approaches aim to\npredict a pre-defined “ground truth,” they are considered su-\npervised learning approaches. Herein, we review AI tools for liver\nimaging in segmentation, classification of disease severity and\nlesions, and outcome prediction.\n"
