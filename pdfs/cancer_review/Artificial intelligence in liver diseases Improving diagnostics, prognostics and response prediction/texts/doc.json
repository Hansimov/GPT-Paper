Clinicians integrate qualitative and quanti-\ntative information from multiple data sources to make a diagnosis, prognosticate the disease\ncourse, and recommend a treatment. In the last 5 years, advances in artificial intelligence (Al),\nparticularly in deep learning, have made it possible to extract clinically relevant information from\ncomplex and diverse clinical datasets. In particular, histopathology and radiology image data\ncontain diagnostic, prognostic and predictive information which AI can extract. Ultimately, such AI\nsystems could be implemented in clinical routine as decision support tools. However, in the context\nof hepatology, this requires further large-scale clinical validation and regulatory approval. Herein,\nwe summarise the state of the art in Al in hepatology with a particular focus on histopathology and\nradiology data. We present a roadmap for the further development of novel biomarkers in hep-\natology and outline critical obstacles which need to be overcome.\n"

These\ntechniques rely on “handcrafted features” defined\nby human investigators. What does this mean in\nthe context of hepatology? An example of AI as\napplied to hepatology is automatic prognostication\nof solid tumours based on imaging data. Using a\nhandcrafted approach, human investigators\nassemble a list of quantitative visual features such\nas tumour size, roundness, symmetry and intensity\non images.* These features are subsequently\ninputted into a classification algorithm, for\nexample, the “random forest” method, which ex-\ncels at categorising such tabular data.° In radiology\nimage analysis, handcrafted image analysis ap-\nproaches are traditionally termed “radiomics” (or\n“classical radiomics”). In addition to this estab-\nlished ML approach, “deep learning” (DL) has\nblossomed in the last 10 years thanks to algo-\nrithmic advances, improved hardware, and large\ndatasets. While conceptually similar to classical ML\napproaches, DL methods usually have thousands\nmore free parameters than classical ML methods.\nThis abundance of parameters makes DL models\nmore flexible and better suited for processing and\nclassifying complex data sets such as language data\nor imaging data.

Based on a quantita-\ntive survey of the MEDLINE database (supplementary\ninformation), researchers from China and the USA are the most\nprolific, with between 30 and 40 total publications on ML/DL in\nhepatology (Fig. 1A). By far the most common application is\nautomatic diagnosis of liver disease from imaging data (Fig. 1B).\nIn these cases, the ground truth is derived from the image data\nitself. For instance, an expert radiologist diagnoses a malignant\nliver mass in a CT dataset and the ML/DL algorithm is tasked with\nreproducing this diagnosis in a supervised training experiment.\nAnother group of studies involves prognosis prediction from\nimage-based data. Forecasting the natural course of a disease can\nhave direct implications for the clinical management of patients.\nAccurate prognostication allows clinicians to adjust follow-up\nintervals, convey the urgency of lifestyle changes to patients,\nand adjust the intensity or type of pharmacological treatment. A\nthird category of applications is segmentation of structures of\ninterest. Segmentation studies aim to generate an accurate\noutline around a region of interest. As a clinical example, algo-\nrithms can delineate organs at risk before radiation therapy of\ncancer. While ML/DL studies in hepatology address a range of\ndiseases, almost all published studies address either neoplastic\nor metabolic diseases of the liver, which are the major causes of\nliver-related morbidity and mortality besides viral hepatitis !*\n(Fig. 1C). ML/DL studies in hepatology currently incorporate a\nrange of imaging modalities. The 3 most commonly analysed\nmodalities are CT scans, MRI scans and H&E-stained histopa-\nthology slides (Fig. 1D). In the last 4 years, the number of ML/DL\nstudies in hepatology has exponentially grown (Fig. 1E), even\nmore so in radiology than in histopathology (Fig. 1F), and only 1\nstudy has combined both data modalities so far.'* In addition, a\ntrend toward a larger growth of DL studies compared to hand-\ncrafted feature-based studies can be observed (Fig. 1G).\n"

However, doctors can include the predictions of Al\nmodels in their recommendations and decisions, and thus use\nexisting information more effectively. This incorporation of Al\nwill require communication platforms, namely, user interfaces,\ndashboards, and innovative visualisation methods, to optimise\nthe flow of information from AI to physicians. In order for AI to\nbe widely adopted by the medical community, “digital literacy”\nneeds to be a core medical competency. A necessary prerequisite\nfor such “digital literacy” is basic knowledge of programming,\nwhich, in principle, can be learned by everyone. In the medical\ncontext, structured training programmes should be employed to\nteach programming. To that end, doctors must learn the neces-\nsary skills to use Al methods in research; validate algorithms in\nclinical studies; and critically question the benefits, data security,\nand possible biases of algorithms, even after regulatory approval.\nIn our experience, it has been especially encouraging to witness\nmedical students and young doctors who are earnestly inter-\nested in gaining a deeper understanding of AI and applying this\ntechnology to clinical problems. In time, this new generation of\ndigital clinician scientists will acquire the rigorous training to\nadvance AI research and pave the way for AI implementation\ninto routine clinical workflows.\n"
