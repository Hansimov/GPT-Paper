            "text": "While the previously described studies focused on models\nimitating human tasks in histopathology, some recent studies\nhave tried to infer clinical endpoints directly from histopathol-\nogy images. As such, Liao et al. developed an image segmentation\npipeline capable of distinguishing HCC from healthy liver tissue\nwith an AUC of 0.87 on an external dataset and calculated a risk\nscore associated with overall survival after resection in patients\nwith HCC, facilitating a significant separation of high- and low-\nrisk patients’ Kaplan Meier survival.°° A group from Japan used\nhandcrafted features from nuclei segmentation to predict early\nrecurrence after resection of HCC with an accuracy of nearly\n0.90.°° The capability of DL algorithms to predict survival of\npatients with HCC from H&E-stained WSIs was impressively\nshown by Saillard et al., in which a DL risk score outperformed\ncommon clinical, biological and pathological features; the\nAmerican Joint Committee on Cancer staging system; and a\ncomposite score of all these variables.*° Histopathology’s po-\ntential for predicting survival was further corroborated by Shi\net al.’s DL model, where a “tumor risk factor” was an indepen-\ndent predictor of overall and recurrence-free survival in multi-\nvariable analysis adjusted for known prognostic factors in\npatients with HCC.*! Yamashita et al. created a risk score\nshowing independent association with recurrence-free survival\nin patients with HCC who underwent cancer resection.’\nApplying new techniques of multimodal data input, He et al.\ncombined histopathology, MRI, and clinical data to train a model\nthat predicted the risk of HCC recurrence in patients after liver\ntransplantation (AUC of 0.87).'* These promising studies are just\nthe tip of the iceberg in an emerging field of research that seeks\nto find better prognostic markers for clinical endpoints and to\nharness the potential of digitised histopathology images to\nsupport physicians in their clinical decision making.\n"
