In that respect, whereas most radiology\nunits in industrialised countries are fully digitised, most pa-\nthology departments are not. Nevertheless, we believe that\ndigitised workflows will soon be adopted by pathology, permit-\nting seamless integration and application of ML/DL tools\namongst departments heavily dependent on imaging. At present,\nmost AI tools are designed for a single specific task. In the future,\nwe envision a standardised software suite that will incorporate\nmany different plug-in options. Ideally, this software suite would\nbe publicly available through an open-source project funded by\ngovernment or independent healthcare institutions. This would\navoid dependency on private companies and nudge industry to\nstandardise its products, reducing the cost and the number of\nproprietary data formats and software solutions. Additionally, a\nsingle software platform would make it easier for medical staff to\nwork with several applications and algorithms, hence reducing\nthe investment in training.\n"

However, doctors can include the predictions of Al\nmodels in their recommendations and decisions, and thus use\nexisting information more effectively. This incorporation of Al\nwill require communication platforms, namely, user interfaces,\ndashboards, and innovative visualisation methods, to optimise\nthe flow of information from AI to physicians. In order for AI to\nbe widely adopted by the medical community, “digital literacy”\nneeds to be a core medical competency. A necessary prerequisite\nfor such “digital literacy” is basic knowledge of programming,\nwhich, in principle, can be learned by everyone. In the medical\ncontext, structured training programmes should be employed to\nteach programming. To that end, doctors must learn the neces-\nsary skills to use Al methods in research; validate algorithms in\nclinical studies; and critically question the benefits, data security,\nand possible biases of algorithms, even after regulatory approval.\nIn our experience, it has been especially encouraging to witness\nmedical students and young doctors who are earnestly inter-\nested in gaining a deeper understanding of AI and applying this\ntechnology to clinical problems. In time, this new generation of\ndigital clinician scientists will acquire the rigorous training to\nadvance AI research and pave the way for AI implementation\ninto routine clinical workflows.\n"
