            "text": "Academic research groups from multiple countries are actively\nengaged in ML/DL research in hepatology. Based on a quantita-\ntive survey of the MEDLINE database (supplementary\ninformation), researchers from China and the USA are the most\nprolific, with between 30 and 40 total publications on ML/DL in\nhepatology (Fig. 1A). By far the most common application is\nautomatic diagnosis of liver disease from imaging data (Fig. 1B).\nIn these cases, the ground truth is derived from the image data\nitself. For instance, an expert radiologist diagnoses a malignant\nliver mass in a CT dataset and the ML/DL algorithm is tasked with\nreproducing this diagnosis in a supervised training experiment.\nAnother group of studies involves prognosis prediction from\nimage-based data. Forecasting the natural course of a disease can\nhave direct implications for the clinical management of patients.\nAccurate prognostication allows clinicians to adjust follow-up\nintervals, convey the urgency of lifestyle changes to patients,\nand adjust the intensity or type of pharmacological treatment. A\nthird category of applications is segmentation of structures of\ninterest. Segmentation studies aim to generate an accurate\noutline around a region of interest. As a clinical example, algo-\nrithms can delineate organs at risk before radiation therapy of\ncancer. While ML/DL studies in hepatology address a range of\ndiseases, almost all published studies address either neoplastic\nor metabolic diseases of the liver, which are the major causes of\nliver-related morbidity and mortality besides viral hepatitis !*\n(Fig. 1C). ML/DL studies in hepatology currently incorporate a\nrange of imaging modalities. The 3 most commonly analysed\nmodalities are CT scans, MRI scans and H&E-stained histopa-\nthology slides (Fig. 1D). In the last 4 years, the number of ML/DL\nstudies in hepatology has exponentially grown (Fig. 1E), even\nmore so in radiology than in histopathology (Fig. 1F), and only 1\nstudy has combined both data modalities so far.'* In addition, a\ntrend toward a larger growth of DL studies compared to hand-\ncrafted feature-based studies can be observed (Fig. 1G).\n"

Nevertheless, once a biopsy\nhas been obtained, there is a clinical need for a fast, definitive,\nreliable, reproducible and quantitative diagnosis.'° It was not\nuntil 2020 that the application of ML/DL methods in liver his-\ntopathology gathered pace.
