            "text": "Clinical routine in hepatology involves the diagnosis and treatment of a wide spectrum of meta-\nbolic, infectious, autoimmune and neoplastic diseases. Clinicians integrate qualitative and quanti-\ntative information from multiple data sources to make a diagnosis, prognosticate the disease\ncourse, and recommend a treatment. In the last 5 years, advances in artificial intelligence (Al),\nparticularly in deep learning, have made it possible to extract clinically relevant information from\ncomplex and diverse clinical datasets. In particular, histopathology and radiology image data\ncontain diagnostic, prognostic and predictive information which AI can extract. Ultimately, such AI\nsystems could be implemented in clinical routine as decision support tools. However, in the context\nof hepatology, this requires further large-scale clinical validation and regulatory approval. Herein,\nwe summarise the state of the art in Al in hepatology with a particular focus on histopathology and\nradiology data. We present a roadmap for the further development of novel biomarkers in hep-\natology and outline critical obstacles which need to be overcome.\n"

These\ntechniques rely on “handcrafted features” defined\nby human investigators. What does this mean in\nthe context of hepatology? An example of AI as\napplied to hepatology is automatic prognostication\nof solid tumours based on imaging data. Using a\nhandcrafted approach, human investigators\nassemble a list of quantitative visual features such\nas tumour size, roundness, symmetry and intensity\non images.* These features are subsequently\ninputted into a classification algorithm, for\nexample, the “random forest” method, which ex-\ncels at categorising such tabular data.° In radiology\nimage analysis, handcrafted image analysis ap-\nproaches are traditionally termed “radiomics” (or\n“classical radiomics”). In addition to this estab-\nlished ML approach, “deep learning” (DL) has\nblossomed in the last 10 years thanks to algo-\nrithmic advances, improved hardware, and large\ndatasets. While conceptually similar to classical ML\napproaches, DL methods usually have thousands\nmore free parameters than classical ML methods.\nThis abundance of parameters makes DL models\nmore flexible and better suited for processing and\nclassifying complex data sets such as language data\nor imaging data.
