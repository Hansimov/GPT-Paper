            "text": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) currently represents the fifth most common malignancy and the third-\nleading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with incidence and mortality rates that are increasing.\nRecently, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a unique opportunity to improve the full spectrum of\nHCC clinical care, by improving HCC risk prediction, diagnosis, and prognostication. Al approaches\ninclude computational search algorithms, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. ML\nconsists of a computer running repeated iterations of models, in order to progressively improve per-\nformance of a specific task, such as classifying an outcome. DL models are a subtype of ML, based on\nneural network structures that are inspired by the neuroanatomy of the human brain. A growing body of\nrecent data now apply DL models to diverse data sources — including electronic health record data,\nimaging modalities, histopathology and molecular biomarkers - to improve the accuracy of HCC risk\nprediction, detection and prediction of treatment response. Despite the promise of these early results,\nfuture research is still needed to standardise AI data, and to improve both the generalisability and\ninterpretability of results. If such challenges can be overcome, Al has the potential to profoundly change\nthe way in which care is provided to patients with or at risk of HCC.\n"
