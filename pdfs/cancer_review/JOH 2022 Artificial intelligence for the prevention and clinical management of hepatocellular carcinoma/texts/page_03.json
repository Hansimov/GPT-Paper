Recently, the\nrapid expansion of available electronic health re-\ncord (EHR) data has provided an opportunity to\nleverage large-scale, longitudinal data elements for\nautomatic feature selection over long-term follow-\nup, and thereby improve HCC risk prediction. To\nthat end, several recent studies have applied Al\napproaches to longitudinal EHR data to improve\nprediction of incident HCC (Table 1). For example,\nin 2013, a supervised ML algorithm was found to\nhave a c-statistic of 0.64 for predicting incident\nHCC in patients with cirrhosis of any aetiology, and\nthis significantly outperformed a conventional\nsystem for HCC risk prediction.? More recently,\nanother model developed in patients with chronic\nhepatitis C infection in the U.S. Veterans Affairs\ncohort demonstrated an AUROC of 0.759 for inci-\ndent HCC.° In all cases, the models constructed by\nAI approaches significantly outperformed tradi-\ntional regression models.\n"
