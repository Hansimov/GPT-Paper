            "text": "While these concepts are still hypothetical, it will\nbe important to integrate Al-based algorithms into\ncurrent and future clinical trials, in order to prove\nthat they are valuable tools to predict responses to\nfirst-line therapy and to predict early progression.\nImplementing these steps will depend on access to\nbiological samples and clinical data within large\nclinical trials, and will require acceptance of these\nconcepts and further that these data are made\naccessible to the clinician scientists who are\ncontributing patients to these trials. To that end,\ncollaborative networks based on trust and united in\nthe collective aim of improving patient outcomes\nneed to be implemented not only between clinicians\nbut also with industry. Nevertheless, it is paramount\nfor any model developed and trained within the\nframework of a clinical trial to be thoroughly vali-\ndated in diverse, real-world patient populations\nbefore clinical implementation, to address possible\nbiases introduced by the trial’s inclusion criteria.\nMoreover, Al-based algorithms and any resultant\nclinical tools must also be constructed with appro-\npriate stakeholder engagement and oversight, to\nensure that validated algorithms are standardised\naccording to protocol and that they are used in the\ncorrect clinical contexts, and further that data\noutput is interpreted properly to maximise clinical\nbenefit. Correctly interpretating data output from an\nAl-based clinical tool will in turn require appro-\npriate training and awareness, both amongst the\npublic and clinical providers.\n"
