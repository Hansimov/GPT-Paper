The testing set then evaluates the utility of\nthe NN for identifying or predicting that output.\nThis validation can be conducted internally or\nexternally. Internal validation is commonly per-\nformed by k-fold cross validation within one\ndataset, by splitting that dataset into k parts and\nthen training k times on k-1 parts, and then sub-\nsequently testing on the remaining part of the\ndataset.
