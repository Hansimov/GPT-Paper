Al approaches\ninclude computational search algorithms, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. ML\nconsists of a computer running repeated iterations of models, in order to progressively improve per-\nformance of a specific task, such as classifying an outcome. DL models are a subtype of ML, based on\nneural network structures that are inspired by the neuroanatomy of the human brain. A growing body of\nrecent data now apply DL models to diverse data sources — including electronic health record data,\nimaging modalities, histopathology and molecular biomarkers - to improve the accuracy of HCC risk\nprediction, detection and prediction of treatment response. Despite the promise of these early results,\nfuture research is still needed to standardise AI data, and to improve both the generalisability and\ninterpretability of results. If such challenges can be overcome, Al has the potential to profoundly change\nthe way in which care is provided to patients with or at risk of HCC.\n"

Despite recent advances in\ntreatment, including the use of atezolizumab plus\nbevacizumab for unresectable HCC, prognosis re-\nmains poor, with a 5-year survival rate of just 15%,\ndue to delays in diagnosis and the limited efficacy\nof existing therapies.** While liver transplantation\ncan be curative for HCC in selected cases, this\nrepresents a limited and resource-intensive solu-\ntion, and the vast majority of patients are not\neligible for transplantation.

Several studies investigated the ability of\nAI methods to predict responses to transarterial\nchemoembolisation (TACE) in patients with\nadvanced HCC. Abajian et al. used handcrafted\nradiomics features from MR images to train logistic\nregression and random forest models to classify\npatients treated with TACE as responders or non-\nresponders. The models achieved a maximal over-\nall accuracy of 78% but revealed the potential of ML\nalgorithms in TACE response prediction.” Classical\nML, as well as DL techniques were used on CT\nimage radiomics features by Liu et al. to develop Al-\nbased prognostic risk factors for overall survival.\n"

While there are signals for\nHCC subgroups with a potentially higher benefit (e.g.\nviral hepatitis vs. non-viral liver disease®*®), there is\nstill no biomarker that reliably predicts therapeutic\nresponse before or very early after starting ICI ther-\napy in patients with HCC. Therefore, a significant\nfraction of patients will be subjected to the (low) risk\nof severe ICI-related toxicity without benefit, thereby\nbeing at an increased risk of tumour progression and\nworsened liver function, while the cost of ICI therapy\nis remarkably high. In this setting, Al-based response\nprediction could play a key role in improving patient\noutcomes and reducing healthcare expenditure.\n"

Similar to a first-line de-\ncision, an algorithm would need to be trained\nwithin clinical trials, first proving that radiological\nprogression can be reliably predicted, e.g. on an\nalgorithm trained on radiology, but also on labo-\nratory values and clinical parameters.
