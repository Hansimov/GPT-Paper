After an initial\nfirst-line therapy, the tumour is evading therapy through resistance mechanisms. The following tumour growth is recognised during radiologic follow-up leading\nto therapy adjustment. (B) Hypothetical, future, Al-supported therapy pattern. Initial, individualized first-line therapy decision, accounting for an Al-based\nrecommendation. After an AI algorithm predicts progression of a tumour, doctors decide to adjust therapy before the tumour can develop resistance to ther-\napy and grow again.\n"

This landmark\napproval marks the beginning of a new era in the\nuse of Al-assisted diagnostics for pathology, and it is\nvery likely that models aiming to assist HCC histo-\nlogical diagnosis/prognosis assessment will also be\navailable soon. They are particularly needed to assist\nwith the differentiation of benign vs. malignant\nhepatocellular tumours, and also for a more robust\nand standardised diagnosis of rare pathological en-\ntities, such as combined hepatocellular-cholangio-\ncarcinoma or fibrolamellar carcinoma.\n"
