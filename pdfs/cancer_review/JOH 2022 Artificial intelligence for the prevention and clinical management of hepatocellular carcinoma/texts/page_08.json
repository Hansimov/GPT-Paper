            "text": "The morphological features of HCC have a\nmajor impact on patient prognosis, and several DL\nalgorithms have thus been developed to improve\nthe prediction of HCC recurrence/survival using\nCT scans, MRI or histopathological images. Saillard\net al. built a model based on the processing of HCC\ndigital slides that was able to predict the survival\nof patients with HCC treated by surgical resection\nwith a higher accuracy than scores including all\nrelevant clinical, biological and pathological fea-\ntures. Notably, they were validated in a series of\ncases for which slides were stained with different\nprotocols, suggesting that such models may\ngeneralise well when tested in different clinical\ncentres.°* A recent study from Yamashita et al.\nconfirmed the capability of AI algorithms to pre-\ndict outcomes based on digital histologic slides.°*\nLu and Daigle used 3 state-of-the-art CNNs (VGG\n16, Inception v3, ResNet50), pretrained on\nImageNet for feature extraction using HCC histo-\npathology slides from the TCGA-LIHC cohort, and\nselected features significantly associated with\nsurvival using multivariable Cox regression anal-\nysis. While this again highlights the possibility of\nperforming outcome prediction using histopa-\nthology slides, the conclusions are limited by the\nmissing adjustment for other prognostic factors,\nas well as the lack of an external validation\ncohort.°° Saito et al. applied classical ML methods\nto handcrafted whole slide image features from a\nrelatively small cohort of 158 patients with HCC to\ndevelop a combined model, predicting HCC\nrecurrence after resection with an accuracy of\n89%. The next step will be to validate these\npromising results in a larger cohort.°°\n"
