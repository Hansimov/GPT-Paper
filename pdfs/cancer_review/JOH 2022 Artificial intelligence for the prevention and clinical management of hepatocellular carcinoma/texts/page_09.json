Transparency (1) consists of having an in-depth knowledge of the structure of the neural network and the activation status of its different\nneurons/nodes. Semantics will provide insights on the type of objects that result in the activation of particular parts of the network).

            "text": "As the performance of AI models is highly depen-\ndent on the amount of data used for training, the\navailability of large data sets is key to fostering the\ndevelopment of research and its future impact on\nclinical care. To this end, the deposition and\nsharing of large datasets should be encouraged.\nThis includes utilisation and sharing of large-scale\ndata from EHRs across and between health sys-\ntems. Moreover, sharing of individual-participant\ndata (IPD) from clinical trials or purely academic\nresearch studies, a clear “ethical and _ scientific\nimperative”, has gained increasing traction and is\nnow advocated by many scientists and organisa-\ntions, and would assist in constructing datasets of\nsufficient size and detail to appropriately train and\nvalidate AI models.’” Moreover, a_ universal,\nstandardised method for addressing and analysing\nmissing data in Al models is necessary, and this is\nparticularly important when considering shared\ndatasets. The International Committee of Medical\nJournal Editors has thus implemented a clinical\ntrial data policy that requires an IPD sharing\nstatement for manuscripts reporting clinical trials.\nAlthough several repositories are now able to store\nIPD and make it available to third parties, the rate\nof sharing remains very low. The main obstacle is\nlikely to be cultural, however other issues remain,\n"
