In clinical practice, when an abdom-\ninal ultrasound shows a new liver lesion, a patient\nis typically referred for further imaging, with\ncontrast-enhanced CT or MRI. Based on the fulfil-\nment of specific radiologic criteria, certain liver\nlesions may be considered as having pathogno-\nmonic features of HCC, and thus do not require\nliver biopsy for further histological confirmation.\nHowever, liver nodules imaged by CT or MRI often\ndemonstrate indeterminate features, for which\ncurrent recommendations include either liver bi-\nopsy or close interval follow-up with serial imag-\ning.”° This practice is sub-optimal, resulting in\nnumerous imaging studies, patient stress, and the\npotential for delayed diagnoses of liver cancer. For\nthis reason, a growing body of recent literature has\nexplored AI approaches to improve risk stratifica-\ntion of indeterminate liver lesions, to facilitate\nearlier and more accurate detection of HCC.\n"

Applying DL\napproaches, the authors constructed a radiomics\nsignature based on 13,920 CT imaging classifiers,\nthat achieved an AUROC of 0.70 for distinguishing\nHCC from non-HCC lesions. Importantly, the au-\nthors demonstrated that the signature was not\ninfluenced by segmentation or by contrast\nenhancement, which adds to its putative general-\nisability.'” Another retrospective study, by Yasaka\net al. (n = 460), utilised CT imaging classifiers from\n3 phases (non-contrast-enhanced, arterial, and\ndelayed) to construct a 3-layer CNN for dis-\ntinguishing a) HCC and non-HCC liver cancers from\n(b) indeterminate liver lesions, haeemangiomas and\ncysts; their CNN had a diagnostic accuracy of 0.84\nwith a median AUROC of 0.92.'° More recently, Shi\nand colleagues compared the performance of a\ntriple-phase contrast-enhanced CT protocol\ncoupled with a DL model, to a four-phase CT pro-\ntocol, for distinguishing HCC from other focal liver\nlesions.'? The authors found that a DL model\ncombined with triple-phase CT protocol without\npre-contrast yielded similar diagnostic accuracy\n(85.6%) to a four-phase protocol (83.3%; p = 0.765).\nThese findings suggest that reducing a patient’s\nradiation dose with a triple-phase CT protocol may\nnot compromise accuracy, and thereby brings the\nfield one step closer to optimising CT protocols for\nthe accurate classification of liver lesions.\n"
