The top three most\nproductive institutions are the League of European Research Universities, Sun Yat\nSen University, and Zhejiang University. Jasjit S. Suri and Frontiers in Oncology are\nthe most published author and journal, respectively. Keyword analysis showed that\nin addition to the research on liver cancer, research on liver cirrhosis, fatty liver\ndisease, and liver fibrosis were also common. Computed tomography was the\nmost used diagnostic tool, followed by ultrasound and magnetic resonance\nimaging. The diagnosis and differential diagnosis of liver cancer are currently the\nmost widely adopted research goals, and comprehensive analyses of multi-type\ndata and postoperative analysis of patients with advanced liver cancer are rare. The\nuse of convolutional neural networks is the main technical method used in studies\nof Al on liver cancer.\n"

With the\ndevelopment of medical imaging, research on medical imaging has\nbeen gradually increasing. CT, ultrasound, and MRI are the top three\nmost used data types. First, this may because CT and MRI can be used\nas the basis for clinical treatment strategies for patients with liver\ncancer based on guidelines for liver cancer diagnosis. Moreover,\nultrasound, as a screening method for patients at high risk of liver\ncancer, needs to be checked every six months. Therefore, the data\nvolume of these three imaging methods has greatly increased, which\nhas promoted the development of AI in liver cancer (37-39). Second,\ncompared with MRI, CT has the advantages of fast inspection speed\nand cost-effectiveness, and is an indispensable and important imaging\nmethod in the diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer. Finally,\nalthough ultrasound is widely used in clinical practice, its image\nacquisition is seriously affected by the doctor’s operation technique\nand machine model, the resolution is low, and the processing is\ndifficult. Therefore, it is used less often than CT. However, it is worth\nnoting that contrast-enhanced ultrasound has now been included as a\nrecommended imaging modality for the diagnosis of liver cancer (40,\n41) and is also widely used in the development and prognostic\nevaluation of ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation. This\nsuggests that we could pay attention to the important role of\nultrasound in liver cancer clinics in future research. At the same\ntime, few studies used pathological, genetic, and other clinical data\n(42-44). The main reason may be that the medical cost of genetic\nexamination is high and the realization of AI in multiomics research\nis difficult.\n"

The results showed that\nAI has undergone rapid development and has a wide application in\nthe diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases, especially in China,\nwhich has one of the highest incidences of liver cancer compared to\nother countries the world. In addition, intelligent analysis of imaging\ndata is the hotspot and focus of current research in this field.\nHowever, combined with the current clinical difficulties such as\naccurate screening of early-stage liver cancer patients and high-risk\npatients, and selection of reasonable treatment decisions for advanced\nliver cancer patients, the use of AI for the fusion analysis of multiple\ntypes data in the process of diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer\nand multi-modal treatment decision-making for liver cancer are still\nrelatively rare, and may become a future research trend.\n"
