            "text": "Liver cancer is an extremely aggressive malignant tumor, ranking\n7\" in incidence and 4\" in mortality worldwide. Studies have revealed\nthat liver cancer has a high recurrence rate and low recovery rate,\nespecially after the middle and late stages, and the 5-year survival rate\nof liver cancer is only 5-30% (1, 2). Therefore, it has become a global\nhealth problem. Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment of liver\ncancer, including improved diagnostic imaging accuracy and\nimproved survival after neoadjuvant or conversion therapy, but it is\nlimited. Accurate screening of early-stage liver cancer patients and\nhigh-risk patients, and rational treatment decisions for patients with\nadvanced stage liver cancer are of great significance for improving the\nquality of life of patients.\n"

Through self-learning, summary, and induction of data, it can\nproduce an intelligent reasoning system and choose the optimal\nsolution to guide clinical decision-making (7). Original AI was\nbased on traditional machine-learning methods, including support\nvector machine and random forest models, which all relied on\nhuman experience for learning and simple summary. As early as\n2003, Hussain constructed a predictive system consisting of 12\ngenes, with Fisher’s linear classifier, for predicting early\nrecurrence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (8).\nDuring this period, most studies have focused on simple analyses of\ndata, such as genes and molecules (9-11). With the standardization\nof imaging diagnosis and its important role in the clinical diagnosis\nof liver cancer, AI research based on imaging has emerged by\nextracting high-throughput features that cannot be detected and\ndefined by human eyes from large-scale image data to establish an\nintelligent decision -making model to assist clinical decision-\nmaking (12, 13). In particular, deep learning based on\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) has promoted progress in\nliver cancer research (14-19).\n"
