Bibliometrics analysis uses mathematical and statistical\nmethods to study the literature system and bibliometric\ncharacteristics in a given field to mine the distribution structure,\nquantitative relationships, and changes of literature in this field.\nVisual display with the help of special software plays an important\nrole in understanding the current development status and\ndevelopment trend of the field. However, our research also has\nlimitations. First, we only included English articles in the WoSCC\ndatabase and did not include articles in other databases or\nlanguages, which could lead to the omission of many studies.\nSecond, keyword screening may not be perfect and could lead to\nomission of literature.\n"
