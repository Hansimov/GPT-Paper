            "text": "Regarding data type, studies of AI in liver cancer started from the\nsimple data modeling of genetic or molecular data (9-11). With the\ndevelopment of medical imaging, research on medical imaging has\nbeen gradually increasing. CT, ultrasound, and MRI are the top three\nmost used data types. First, this may because CT and MRI can be used\nas the basis for clinical treatment strategies for patients with liver\ncancer based on guidelines for liver cancer diagnosis. Moreover,\nultrasound, as a screening method for patients at high risk of liver\ncancer, needs to be checked every six months. Therefore, the data\nvolume of these three imaging methods has greatly increased, which\nhas promoted the development of AI in liver cancer (37-39). Second,\ncompared with MRI, CT has the advantages of fast inspection speed\nand cost-effectiveness, and is an indispensable and important imaging\nmethod in the diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer. Finally,\nalthough ultrasound is widely used in clinical practice, its image\nacquisition is seriously affected by the doctorâ€™s operation technique\nand machine model, the resolution is low, and the processing is\ndifficult. Therefore, it is used less often than CT. However, it is worth\nnoting that contrast-enhanced ultrasound has now been included as a\nrecommended imaging modality for the diagnosis of liver cancer (40,\n41) and is also widely used in the development and prognostic\nevaluation of ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation. This\nsuggests that we could pay attention to the important role of\nultrasound in liver cancer clinics in future research. At the same\ntime, few studies used pathological, genetic, and other clinical data\n(42-44). The main reason may be that the medical cost of genetic\nexamination is high and the realization of AI in multiomics research\nis difficult.\n"
