The results showed that\nAI has undergone rapid development and has a wide application in\nthe diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases, especially in China,\nwhich has one of the highest incidences of liver cancer compared to\nother countries the world. In addition, intelligent analysis of imaging\ndata is the hotspot and focus of current research in this field.\nHowever, combined with the current clinical difficulties such as\naccurate screening of early-stage liver cancer patients and high-risk\npatients, and selection of reasonable treatment decisions for advanced\nliver cancer patients, the use of AI for the fusion analysis of multiple\ntypes data in the process of diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer\nand multi-modal treatment decision-making for liver cancer are still\nrelatively rare, and may become a future research trend.\n"
