The study of Al in liver cancer mostly began from 2003 and has\ndeveloped rapidly from 2017. China has the largest number of publications, and the\nUnited States has the highest H-index and total citation counts. The top three most\nproductive institutions are the League of European Research Universities, Sun Yat\nSen University, and Zhejiang University. Jasjit S. Suri and Frontiers in Oncology are\nthe most published author and journal, respectively. Keyword analysis showed that\nin addition to the research on liver cancer, research on liver cirrhosis, fatty liver\ndisease, and liver fibrosis were also common. Computed tomography was the\nmost used diagnostic tool, followed by ultrasound and magnetic resonance\nimaging. The diagnosis and differential diagnosis of liver cancer are currently the\nmost widely adopted research goals, and comprehensive analyses of multi-type\ndata and postoperative analysis of patients with advanced liver cancer are rare. The\nuse of convolutional neural networks is the main technical method used in studies\nof Al on liver cancer.\n"
