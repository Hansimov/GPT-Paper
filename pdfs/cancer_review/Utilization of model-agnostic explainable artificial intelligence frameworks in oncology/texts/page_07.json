Like\nradiomics, pathology is also a field highly interested in\nindividual predictions, where both SHAP and LIME can\noften be applicable. In a study similar to the one performed\nby Gaur et a/.

Given\nthat this problem involved a convolution neural network\nand was primarily interested in individual patients, this\nwas a prime example where LIME was a good choice,\nwhere SHAP would be more computationally inefficient.\nUsing this method, the model output can overlay histology\nslides, and end-users can see locations of interest identified\nby the model. These overlays permitted the authors to\nbiologically validate results by comparing highlighted\nareas of interest with clinical intuition.
