In oncology,\nthis might mean using imaging characteristics to predict\ntumor molecular features, behavior, and prognosis. In\ndoing so, a patient’s image might be input into a radiomic\nalgorithm and predict risk of relapse. However accurate\nsuch a prediction might be, it is also of vital importance that\nproviders be able to understand why the imaging produces\nsuch a prediction.\n"

Several\nradiomics studies focus on using XAI and focusing\non individual predictions. One example that has been\nexplored in the literature is molecular classification\nof gliomas. In gliomas, molecular subtypes related to\nisocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations and 1p/19q co-\ndeletion are of vital relevance to prognosis and might also\ninform treatment options (30). Although confirmation of\nsuch abnormalities occurs via pathologic analysis, it can be\nuseful to identify patients with such abnormalities prior\nto surgery or if pathologic conformation is not possible.\nManikis et a/. reported on radiomic patterns that can\npredict IDH mutational status with an accuracy of 73.6%\nand an associated sensitivity and specificity of 0.6 and\n0.736, respectively (31). Following model development,\nresults were explained using both the SHAP and LIME\nframeworks, which were able to identify important\nradiomic features that lead to an image being classified\nas IDH-mutant, which the authors were then able to\ncorrelate with biological behavior of [DH-mutant gliomas.\n"

This is particularly relevant in\nradiomics, where massive amounts of data points might be\ngenerated from a given image set. A challenge XAI helps\naddress is identifying only the most important features\npredictive of the outcome, which improves final model\nfeature selection, thus eliminating the irrelevant ones,\nleading to a better model that is more robust and less prone\nto overfitting. Kha et a/. have reported on identification of\na radiomic signature predictive of 1p/19q co-deletion (34).\nDuring model development, the SHAP framework was used\nto identify the most important features to include in their\nmodel, leading to improved model performance when less\nimportant features, based on average SHAP values, were\nremoved, with an AUC of 0.710 before feature selection\nand 0.753 after.\n"
