Meena et a/. developed a model\nfor diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) based on\ngenetic signature (42). In a simple example of how SHAP\nvalues can be powerful, when distinguishing between\nhealthy tissue and SCC, only a single gene (HNRNPM)\nproduced a significant impact on the model, which was\ninterestingly not among the 20 most important genes in\nactinic keratosis based on SHAP values. Although accurate\ndiagnosis of SCC is useful, and the model was 92.86%\naccurate, these signatures made available by XAI are highly\nvaluable to end-users evaluating reports without access\nto sophisticated models, permitting powerful qualitative\nconclusions. Similar approaches have been applied to\nhematopoietic cancer subtype classification (accuracy of\n97.01%) (43).\n"
