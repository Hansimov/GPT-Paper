This information permits the model to be both\npredictive and able to inform possible interventions. In a\nstudy by Kobylinska et a/., XAI was used to investigate the\ninfluence of factors on lung cancer screening (53). The\nauthors used the SHAP framework to produce summary\nplots, to overall illustrate lung cancer risk in lung cancer\nscreening populations, dependence plots to show how\nchanging individual variables influenced risk, and plots of\nindividual predictions, which can be used how individual\npatient risk is calculated. This information is useful, as it\ncan be broadly used to counsel patients on decreasing lung\ncancer risk, but can also inform specific patients of the best\nway to decrease their risk by identifying the most impactful\nfactors to them.\n"
