            "text": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common subtype of liver cancer, and assessing its histopathological grade requires\nvisual inspection by an experienced pathologist. In this study, the histopathological H&E images from the Genomic Data Commons\nDatabases were used to train a neural network (inception V3) for automatic classification. According to the evaluation of our model\nby the Matthews correlation coefficient, the performance level was close to the ability of a 5-year experience pathologist, with\n96.0% accuracy for benign and malignant classification, and 89.6% accuracy for well, moderate, and poor tumor differentiation.\nFurthermore, the model was trained to predict the ten most common and prognostic mutated genes in HCC. We found that four of\nthem, including CTNNB1, FMN2, TP53, and ZFX4, could be predicted from histopathology images, with external AUCs from 0.71 to\n0.89. The findings demonstrated that convolutional neural networks could be used to assist pathologists in the classification and\ndetection of gene mutation in liver cancer.\n"
