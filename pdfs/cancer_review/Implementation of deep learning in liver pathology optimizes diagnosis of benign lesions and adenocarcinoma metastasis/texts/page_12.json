Moreover, it is uncommon\nthat resection of liver metastases of pancreatic adeno-\ncarcinoma is performed, since prior studies suggested\nno survival benefit of surgery in this setting.*’ There-\nfore, large numbers of the respective tissue samples are\nlacking. In our study, we included a series of 103 cases\nfor liver metastases of colorectal adenocarcinoma and\nnotably, 101 of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In particu-\nlar, the latter is a considerably large cohort given the\nabove-mentioned restrictions. Summarizing all classes, the\noverall number of patients and importantly image patches\n(204.159) used in this study is far above the range reported\nin other studies on gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary\ntumours.*”\n"

Although there are few exceptions,” the vast\nmajority of deep learning studies do not provide anno-\ntated data, a full dataset of image patches and/or codes,\nresulting in published data and algorithms that cannot be\nindependently validated or improved. To address these two\nissues, we have annotated seven categories in liver tissue\nincluding normal anatomical tissue structures, benign and\nmalignant lesions and provided the dataset and code. Our\ndata will allow clinical pathologists and researchers to vali-\ndate their results and develop novel deep learning methods\nto support histopathological diagnostics and ultimately, to\nimplement these tools in patient care clinics. By provid-\ning these data from normal anatomical tissue structures,\nour algorithm can in principle be applied to classify whole\nslide sections, which avoids manual and time consuming\nannotation of tumour regions prior to classification (see\nFigure 1).\n"

It is remarkable that the model per-\nformed very well on the differentiation of benign bile duct\nlesions such as peribiliary hamartoma and biliary ade-\nnoma from metastasis from pancreatic adenocarcinoma, a\nparticularly challenging task even for specialized and expe-\nrienced pathologist. The most common misclassification\non the image tile level occurred for pancreatic predicted\nas colorectal adenocarcinoma (44%). On the case level,\nfive out of a total of 20 cases were misclassified for this\ntask (25%). For further optimization, a larger number of\npatients would be necessary, a limitation of our study.\nHowever, since the decision making of adenocarcinoma\nwas correct with very high confidence in all cases, the final\nhistological differentiation of colorectal and pancreatic\nadenocarcinoma could be validated by further immuno-\nhistological stainings. In this regard, we believe that our\nalgorithm shows a considerably strong and applicable per-\nformance, since final decision is still made by surgical\npathologists.\n"
