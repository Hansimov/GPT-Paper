Our network can be\nimplemented in surgical pathology diagnostics to detect\nthe most frequent types of adenocarcinoma metastasis\nin the liver with high accuracy and discrimination from\nbenign structures. The trained model should provide\nmore diagnostic confidence, uses small tissue samples,\navoids multiple biopsies, assures diagnostic quality, and\nshould help with the shrinking pathology resources. In\naddition, the provided huge raw dataset can be extended\nby pathologists and researchers to refine classification\nalgorithms.\n"
