The use of digital pathology tools will improve\nthe overall attractiveness to the field of surgical pathol-\nogy, which is required to sustain the increase in numbers\nof complex cases and decline in specialized pathologists.’\nSecond, digital scanning has the advantage of automatic\nquality control, which can be performed for each slide,\nfor example, to test for equivalency of block and slide\nnumbers or to assess correct staining. Thus, some steps in\nthe workflow, such as assigning slides to cases or archiv-\ning, can be accelerated. Third, digital images are usually\nsaved on local hard drives for a certain period of time,\nwhich allows a rapid comparison of current to prior speci-\nmen. Besides the aforementioned infrastructural features,\ndigitalization of tissue sections allows the application of\ndeep learning algorithms with the potential to support\nthe objective, consistent clinical and diagnostic decision\nmaking.”>°\n"
