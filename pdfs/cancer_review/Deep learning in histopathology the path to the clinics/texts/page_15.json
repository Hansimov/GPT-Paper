            "text": "Promising results of the application of Al to histopathological images have provoked a large number\nof research studies, now resulting in CPATH solutions that have comparable performance to\npathologists for several specific diagnostic tasks. In addition to the use of Al to conduct human expert\ndiagnostic tasks, we have only begun to scratch the surface with respect to the use of Al for discovery\nof prognostic features, prediction of therapy success or assessment of the relation between the\nmorphological phenotypes of disease and genotypes. Whereas many technical challenges have been\novercome, clinical usefulness has not been proven yet and several hurdles still have to be overcome.\nNext to the challenge of collecting sufficiently large sets of annotated WSI, prospective studies have\nto be conducted to show the true benefit of Al for histopathological diagnostics. Issues related to\nexplainability, ethics and regulation are also insufficiently studied and will require more attention in\nthe near future. Even though the field is not fully matured yet, we expect CPATH to play a dominant\nrole in the future of histopathology, making diagnostics more efficient and accurate, helping\npathologists meet the requirements of an increasing number of patients and the need for more\nextensive and accurate histopathological assessment to aid the increasing spectrum of treatment\noptions for many diseases.\n"
