            "text": "In addition to automating current diagnostic tasks, CPATH methods can also be used to support\npathologists with additional information; for example, by showing the 2mm hotspots of mitotic cells\nin breast cancer WSI that are required for tumor grading as advised by guidelines for treatment of\npatients with breast cancer (e.g., as published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology; ASCO)\n[157]. This approach performs similarly to pathologists and can reduce inter-observer variability [147].\nHighlighting regions of prostate cancer using different colors to represent different Gleason grades\n[62] [63] and highlighting lung cancer growth patterns by adenocarcinoma subtype [36] [64] using\nCPATH methods have produced similar results. Furthermore, a combination of segmentation,\ndetection and classification methods can enable the objective quantification of established\nbiomarkers that are used in clinical practice. One example is the assessment of tumor infiltrating\nlymphocytes (TILs) [65], which can be achieved by segmenting stromal regions of a slide and detecting\nintrastromal lymphocytes by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining [66] [51] or by\nimmunohistochemistry (IHC) [50]. Using this method, the presence of TILs was shown to correlate with\nrecurrence and genetic mutations in lung adenocarcinoma [67]. Other examples of biomarkers include\nthose related to the amount of intra-tumoral stroma [68], such as the tumor-stroma ratio [69], which\ncan be assessed by computing the ratio between the tumor and tumor-associated stroma obtained\nvia image segmentation, and the quantification of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive cells,\nwhich is used to stratify patients for immunotherapy and can be achieved via the detection of positive\n(and possibly negative) cells, by segmentation of PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative regions [70], or\neven predicted from H&E slides [71].\n"

Following the promising results of the early CPATH applications, the size of\ndatasets has increased, leading to an increasing number of multi-centric efforts to cope with the large\nvariability in staining, image quality, scanning characteristics, and tissue preparation across different\nlabs. One example of how datasets have grown is in the use of Al for prostate cancer detection, one\nmethod of which was developed using a dataset of 254 prostate tissue samples in 2016 [13], whereas\na method proposed in 2019 used a dataset with >24,000 prostate tissue samples [72].
