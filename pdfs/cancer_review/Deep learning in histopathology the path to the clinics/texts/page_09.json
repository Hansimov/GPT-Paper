Other challenges, such as\ndifficulties in explaining how CPATH algorithms work are, in our view, less of a barrier than often\nthought [159].

Although dataset sizes for developing\nCPATH algorithms have grown substantially over the past few years, many still lack an important\ncharacteristic in that they are not representative of the type of data that is encountered in clinical\npractice [123]. This data has many more sources of variation than the datasets used in research\npapers. Although most work now tries to account for variations caused by different scanners or\nstaining techniques by including data from different labs, the number of labs included is typically too\nsmall for a true assessment of generalizability [120]. The number of labs that would need to be\nincluded to be representative would depend on the diagnostic question and, up until now, this aspect\nof CPATH has been poorly investigated. Other sources of variation have not yet been taken into\naccount in CPATH, such as differing patient populations between centers or countries, although they\nare starting to be considered in other fields such as radiology [110]. Such variation can cause subtle\nsources of bias in CPATH algorithms, as seen in other settings [131].\n"
