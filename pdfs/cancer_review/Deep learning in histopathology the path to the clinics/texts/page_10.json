The hypothesis is\nthat if variability can be removed and all (future) target images translated to a well-defined standard\n(mostly in terms of color specifications) then even a CPATH algorithm built on a narrow set of training\nimages would perform consistently well. The price that is paid for this approach is the need to\ntransform every target image before applying the CPATH model, which may be computationally costly.\nBoth data augmentation and image normalization are necessary requisites to increase generalizability\nof deep learning models [113], and should therefore be considered in the development of any CPATH\napproach.\n"

For example, if an algorithm that was trained to detect breast\ncancer metastases in lymph nodes was confronted with lymphoma, the outcome would be uncertain.\nIf such an algorithm were used to filter out obviously negative WSI (without lymph node metastases),\nwhich do not need to be inspected by a pathologist, serious diseases could remain undetected. One\npossible solution is to train algorithms for all possible pathologies; however, such an approach may be\nimpractical or even impossible in most cases. An alternative approach is the development of CNN\ntechniques that yield, in addition to the network output, a score that expresses the certainty of the\nCNN for that specific output [152] [153], which would offer CNNs the ability to essentially state ‘I do\nnot know’.\n"
