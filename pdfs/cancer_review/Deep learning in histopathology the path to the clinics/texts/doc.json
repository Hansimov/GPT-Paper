Research in this area began as early as the 1960’s, with the initial application of image\nanalysis algorithms to images of cells. Individual cells in blood smears could be classified into subtypes,\non the basis of quantitative cell characteristics such as size, shape and chromatin distribution, to\nanalyze the blood composition and help diagnose a range of diseases [6]. Early CPATH applications\nattempted to implement computational features that were painstakingly matched to a biological\nprocess or shape, and were later replaced by radiomics or pathomics approaches using generic\n‘feature banks’ of texture descriptors (i.e. a quantitative description of the characteristics of image\ntextures, such as orientation, contrast etc.)[7], operating under the assumption that complex\nclassifiers could eventually find the intricate relationships among these features for specific\nclassification tasks. For example, Kather et al showed that combining five different types of texture\ndescriptors resulted in a classifier that could recognize tumor and stroma in colorectal tissue sections\nwith 98.6% accuracy [155].\n"

                    "text": "The almost complete transition from feature engineering to deep learning occurred for several\nreasons. For medical imaging, and thus also for CPATH, perhaps the most important reason is the fact\nthat the construction of algorithms (almost) entirely by training, rather than by explicit programming\nor by using predefined filters, yields powerful, hierarchical feature representations that, in most cases,\noutperform more traditional image analysis methods [3]. As a consequence, the need to have domain\nknowledge in order to achieve good results is reduced because feature engineering requires the\ndefinition of problem-specific features, whereas in deep learning, the networks learn meaningful\nfeatures autonomously from the data. Automatically learning features from the data also leads to\nreduced implementation time. In feature engineering, crafting meaningful characteristics for the data\nat hand generally requires several iterations per feature and sometimes lengthy and repeated\ndiscussions with pathologists to understand what cues are used during their diagnostic process. In the\nera of deep learning, such trajectories can be reduced to months, sometimes even weeks, while\nbreaking boundaries in terms of diagnostic performance. Lastly, the importance of freely available\nsource code for the most successful neural network architectures cannot be understated.\n"

The field has\nfollowed a trend that was previously experienced by the computer vision community, which focusses\nits research on computational analysis of natural images, i.e. real-world photographs and videos. Initial\nreports in 2011 of efficiently training convolutional neural networks (CNN), a particular type of deep\nlearning algorithm, using graphics processing units (GPUs) [9], led to the design of much deeper CNNs\nthat outperformed the state of the art (mostly using machine learning based on handcrafted features)\nin the classification of natural images. Specifically, in the ImageNet challenge, which required\ncategorization of one million photographs in a thousand different classes ranging from specific breeds\nof dogs to airplanes and cars, these new deep neural networks reduced the error rate from 25% to 4%\nin only three years.. CPATH researchers took note of the successes of applying CNNs in computer\nvision, initially presenting methods that solely focused on the analysis of small cropped areas from\nWSI, such as mitosis counting [10]. Methods that used entire WSI followed for applications such as\nbreast cancer segmentation [11], glioma classification [12], non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [156],\nassessment of renal transplant biopsies [19] and prostate cancer detection [13].\n"

However, end-to-end approaches cannot\nstraightforwardly be applied to WSI classification, mainly because gigapixel WSI are too large in size\nand do not fit into the memory of modern GPUs. Even switching to central processing unit\ncomputation would not resolve this problem, as a single WSI can easily require tens of gigabytes of\nmemory at full resolution. Researchers have tried to overcome this limitation through different\nmethodological innovations. A simple approach to tackle this problem is to assume that all patches in\nthe WSI contain morphological information that correlates with the WSl-level label; for example, all\npatches extracted from a WSI that contains tumor also contain tumor. Despite the simplicity of this\nassumption, it can be effective for some applications [87] [24], although it will not work when rare or\nsmall objects have to be found [88], such as small metastases in lymph nodes. The previous\nassumption can be refined by adopting a multiple instance learning (MIL) approach [89], in which at\nleast one small region in the image is considered to contain morphological information that is needed\nto classify the image; for example, the presence of a single small region containing cancer is sufficient\nto label the entire WSI as containing cancer [90] [72] [91].\n"

CPATH solutions based on deep learning models are often described as ‘black\nboxes’, indicating that because of the nature of these systems (being trained rather than explicitly\nprogrammed), it is very difficult for humans to understand the exact underlying functioning of the\nsystem [159]. As a result, correcting certain erroneous behaviors may be more difficult, and\nacceptance by humans (as well as regulatory approval) may be hampered [123]. This problem has\ngiven rise to research on ‘explainable Al’, in which techniques are developed that enable better\nunderstanding of the functioning of deep learning models. Current state-of-the-art of methods that\ncan shed light inside the black box have been extensively reviewed elsewhere [124]. Interestingly, the\nauthors of that survey [124] conclude that there is no consensus on the exact meaning of the term\n‘explainable’, as it has different requirements in different contexts and for different stakeholders.\nAlthough techniques for improving the explainability of Al will support acceptance by the community,\nthe emphasis that should be placed on precise understanding of the mechanics of the technology,\nrather than on the functioning of the system as a whole in the context in which it is used [125], is\ndebatable, especially when such systems are integrated into the clinical workflow of pathology\ndiagnostics. Rigorous validation and quality assurance and checking procedures will be critical to prove\nthe correct functioning of CPATH solutions, both at initial market entrance and also after future\nupdates. This topic is highly relevant to regulatory bodies such as the FDA, which has recently\n"

The use of patient data and the deployment of machines that aid diagnostics, potentially\neven in a (partly) autonomous fashion, leads to a number of ethical concerns. The development of\nCPATH solutions requires large amounts of data (both images and associated meta-data). The use of\nhuman data for healthcare research and product development in general creates ethical and legal\nchallenges that have to be addressed properly. Respecting patient privacy and obtaining approval for\nuse of data are important requirements to comply with. Unfortunately, from a practical standpoint,\nthese requirements may reduce the options for the re-use of existing data for Al development, and\nmay lead to increased costs to arrive at the required numbers of cases. A careful balancing between\nprivacy protection and the benefits of data-driven innovation is needed [126] that requires the\ninvolvement of all stakeholders [127]. In addition, the collection of data at the scale needed for CPATH\ndevelopment (thousands of cases), which can be mad e publicly available, complicates matters even\nfurther. Aside from the danger of data breaches, collecting large amounts of data may enable\nresearchers to make connections that were previously not possible, potentially putting patient privacy\nat risk even if data are collected in an anonymized manner [126], [123]. An alternative to establishing\nlarge, multicenter datasets in a central location for machine learning is the application of so-called\nfederated learning strategies. With federated learning, the procedure for training the machine\nlearning models is adapted so that it can deal with data residing in separate locations, obviating the\nneed to bring the data together and thereby circumventing some of the problems described above\n[128] [129].\n"
