However, quantitative evaluation of this information\nis challenging with the naked eyes of pathologists. Deep\nlearning could automatically extract imaging features which\nare invisible to human observers and potentially provide\nimportant clinical, biological and molecular-morphologic\ninformation [14]. Previous studies on deep-learning models\nin other tumors also indicated the possibility of predicting\nfeatures outside the tumor (such as lymph node metastasis)\nby evaluating information from tumor areas only [15, 16].\nTherefore, constructing a deep-learning model based on the\nimaging information of tumor areas might have the potential\nto evaluate MVI status effectively and assist with the clinical\nmanagement of HCC patients.\n"
