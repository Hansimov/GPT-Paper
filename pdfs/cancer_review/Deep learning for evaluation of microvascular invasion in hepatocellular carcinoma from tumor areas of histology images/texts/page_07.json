First, we validated\nthe performance of the MVI-DL model using only one WSI\nfrom each patient in the FAHSYSU and DG-SD test set to\nsimulate patients with limited surgical margins. The results\nshowed that the AUC was 0.875 (95% CI 0.855—0.895) and\n0.837 (95% CI 0.800—0.874), respectively (Fig. 5b). The\ndetailed evaluation metrics are shown in Table S6. Addi-\ntionally, we also performed a sensitivity analysis to explore\nthe impact of the number of the WSIs per patient fed to the\nmodel on the performance of the MVI-DL model, and the\nresults showed that the predictive accuracy of the model did\nnot increase significantly as the number of the input WSIs\nincreased (the AUCs range from 0.849 to 0.878, Fig. S7).\nThen, we validated the performance of MVI-DL model in\nsimulated biopsy specimens to evaluate the performance of\nthe MVI-DL model in patients with only biopsy tissues. The\nresults showed that the predictive performance positively\ncorrelated with the number and length of simulated biopsy\ntissues (Fig. 5c, Table S6 and Fig. S8), and the AUC reached\n0.879 (95% CI 0.853—0.906) by three biopsies and similar\ntrends were shown in the external test set.\n"
