MVI is also the only histo-\nlogical feature that has been proven to be predictive of the\nefficacy of adjuvant therapy by a clinical trial [5]. Addi-\ntionally, MVI status can also be an indicator for therapeutic\ndecision-making in recurrent HCC [6].

Nevertheless, in clinical practice, not all patients could\nobtain sufficient sampling tissues for MVI evaluation. More\nthan 60% of HCC patients received nonsurgical treatment\nwith only biopsy specimens [10]. For patients who receive\nsurgical treatment, the background cirrhosis leads to a con-\nsiderable portion of them having narrow surgical margins\nto maintain sufficient remnant liver volume [11]. According\nto the previous studies, the proportion of HCC patients with\nmargins < 0.5 cm ranged from 43.6 to 44.2% [7].
