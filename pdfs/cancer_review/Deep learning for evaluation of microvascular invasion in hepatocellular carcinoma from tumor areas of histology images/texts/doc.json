The scattered distribution of MVI could cause\ndifficulties in constructing a detection model directly from\nthe peri-tumoral area. Not all slides from MVI (+) patients\ncontain MVIs leads to a high false-positive rate in MVI\nlabels. The tumor area-based MVI-DL model we constructed\npredicts the existence of MVI by certain MVI-associated his-\ntological features in the tumor area instead of trying to find\nthe location of MVI, avoiding the inconsistent labels in dif-\nferent slides. Interestingly, we found that the performances\nof tumor area-based models were diverse under different\nmagnifications. The 40 x model showed limited predictive\nefficacy compared with the lower magnifications. The reason\ncould be that images under different magnifications reveal\ndifferent types of histological features [23]. Images under\n40 x magnification better reflect the characteristics of tumor\ncell morphology and internal cell structure, while images\nunder lower magnifications reflect the tumor cell morphol-\nogy and the relationship between tumor cells and their sur-\nrounding microenvironments, such as tumor-associated\nstromal cells and tumor-infiltrated lymphocytes. Therefore,\nwe speculate that the relationship of tumor cells and their\nsurrounding microenvironments may be more important for\npredicting MVI. By assembling models under different mag-\nnifications, the final MVI-DL model better combined cell\nmorphology, tumor microenvironment and intercell relation-\nships, and achieved better predictive performance.\n"

We found that macrotrabecular archi-\ntecture with a rich blood sinus, rich tumor stroma, high\nintratumor heterogeneity, severe immune cell infiltration\nand highly differentiated tumor cells strongly contributed\nto the MVI prediction, all of which were features of cell\nmorphology, tumor microenvironment and intercell rela-\ntionships. Previous studies have shown that macrotrabecu-\nlar architecture in HCC indicates stronger tumor invasive-\nness [12, 24]. This type of HCC can express high levels of\nangiopoietin 2 and vascular endothelial growth factor A to\nregulate angiogenesis and vascular remodeling and is more\nlikely to develop vascular invasion and metastasis [12, 25].\nA rich tumor stroma may promote the production of TGF-\nB, which directly upregulates the expression of tumor stem\ncell markers (EpCAM, K19, CD133, etc.), thereby promot-\ning vascular invasion [13].

Second,\nthe performance of this model in biopsy specimens was in a\nsimulated scenario. Since that the diagnosis of HCC did not\nrequire preoperative biopsy, patients with both preoperative\nbiopsy tissue and confirmed MVI diagnosis from postopera-\ntive histology were limited, making it hard to evaluate in this\npopulation. Third, this study is a retrospective cohort study,\nand a large prospective clinical trial is necessary for the\nimplementation of the MVI-DL model in clinical practice.\n"
