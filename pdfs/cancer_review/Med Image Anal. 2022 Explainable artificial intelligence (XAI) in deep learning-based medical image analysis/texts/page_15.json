            "text": "Other directions of XAI in medical image analysis may include\nthe link between causality and XAI. Typical medical image analy-\nsis consists of correlation rather than causation. Causality describes\nthe relation between cause and effect, and can be mathematically\ndescribed (Pearl, 2009). Current XAI techniques that aim to be free\nof bias such as prototypes are potentially still sensitive to differ-\nences in training population, which might hamper generalizability.\nCastro et al. (2020) describe how causal reasoning may be useful\nto assess biases in the data. DeGrave et al. (2021) gave an exam-\nple how dataset bias can be detected using XAI: In studies that\ndistinguish between X-rays of patients who were Coronavirus dis-\nease 2019 (COVID-19)-positive and of patients who were COVID-\n19-negative, they used visual explanation to demonstrate that high\nperformance of the deep learning models was actually attributed\nto how the datasets were composed, rather than to actual COVID-\n19 detection in the X-rays. van Amsterdam et al. (2019) show an\nexample of eliminating bias using causality, yielding unbiased pre-\ndiction of prognosis for patients with lung cancer. It would be of\ninterest to incorporate such analyses in explanation of medical im-\nages, as Chattopadhyay et al. (2019) have done for visual explana-\ntion of MNIST data.\n"
