Features included low-level im-\nage properties such as edges or corners, but also higher-level im-\nage properties such as the spiculated border of a cancer. In deep\nlearning, these features are learned by a neural network (in con-\ntrast to being handcrafted) to optimally give a result (or output)\ngiven an input.
