However, as many as 70% of patients still experience tumor recurrence\nat 5 years post-surgery. We developed and validated a deep learning-based system (HCC-SurvNet)\nthat provides risk scores for disease recurrence after primary resection, directly from hematoxylin\n\nand eosin-stained digital whole-slide images of formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded liver resections.\nOur model achieved concordance indices of 0.724 and 0.683 on the internal and external test cohorts,\nrespectively, exceeding the performance of the standard Tumor-Node-Metastasis classification\nsystem. The model's risk score stratified patients into low- and high-risk subgroups with statistically\nsignificant differences in their survival distributions, and was an independent risk factor for post-\nsurgical recurrence in both test cohorts. Our results suggest that deep learning-based models can\nprovide recurrence risk scores which may augment current patient stratification methods and help\nrefine the clinical management of patients undergoing primary surgical resection for HCC.\n"

Despite advances in prevention, surveillance, early detection, and treat-\nment, its incidence and cancer-specific mortality continue to rise, with the majority of patients still presenting\nat advanced stages’”. To stratify patients according to their expected outcome in order to optimize treatment\nstrategies, several staging systems, such as the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/International\nUnion against Cancer (UICC) Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM)? and the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC)\nsystems‘, have been proposed and validated. However, as many as 70% of patients still have tumor recurrence\nwithin 5 years post-treatment**’’, including both true recurrence due to intrahepatic metastasis and de novo\nprimary cancers arising in the background liver, as the majority of HCCs occur in patients with underlying\nchronic liver disease that directly contributes to the development of HCC. Therefore, further refinement and\nimprovement of recurrence risk stratification is warranted.\n"
