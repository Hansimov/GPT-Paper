We developed and validated a deep learning-based system (HCC-SurvNet)\nthat provides risk scores for disease recurrence after primary resection, directly from hematoxylin\n\nand eosin-stained digital whole-slide images of formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded liver resections.\nOur model achieved concordance indices of 0.724 and 0.683 on the internal and external test cohorts,\nrespectively, exceeding the performance of the standard Tumor-Node-Metastasis classification\nsystem.

Previous other studies’’ have also developed\nmodels for the prediction of overall survival in post-surgical HCC patients, also by using clinicopathologic data\nfrom the TCGA. However, use of TCGA clinicopathologic data presents some significant limitations which are\noften overlooked. These include the fact that the AJCC TNM classifications used across cases in the TCGA-LIHC\ndataset range from the 4th through the 7th editions, resulting in inconsistency in the meaning of the pathologic\nT, N, and M categories across different patients resected during different time periods. In addition, the pathol-\nogy reports in TCGA-LIHC came from different institutions with wide variation in the reporting of pathologic\nfeatures. Therefore, prior to use of TCGA data, standardization, in particular, of all pathologic variables, as per-\nformed in this study, is necessary. As the TCGA data were collected from 35 different institutions, each with dif-\nferent H&E staining and digitization protocols, we constructed a mixed-effect Cox model to account for potential\nintraclass correlations present between WSI originating from the same institution. After taking the originating\ninstitution into account as a random effect, we found that HCC-SurvNet’s risk score remained an independent\npredictor of recurrence-free interval, along with the histologic grade and the presence of macrovascular invasion.\n"

S.). Forty-seven patients were excluded because their\nresections were performed for recurrent HCC, two were excluded because of lack of follow-up data after surgi-\ncal resection, and three were excluded due to the presence of comorbidities known to have contributed to the\npatients’ deaths. This process narrowed the final number of study patients down to 198. From each of these 198\npatients, a representative tumor H&E slide (the one containing the highest grade of tumor in the specimen) was\ndigitized at high resolution (40 x objective magnification, 0.25 um per pixel) on an Aperio AT2 scanner (Leica\nBiosystems, Nussloch, Germany), to generate a WSI in the SVS file format. This dataset (n= 198 WSL, from 198\nunique patients), referred to as the Stanford-HCC dataset, was used for external evaluation of the risk score\nprediction model. From the excluded patient pool (not included in Stanford-HCC), 36 patients were randomly\nselected and a representative tumor H&E slide from each patient was digitized using the exact same method as\ndescribed above, yielding a dataset with 36 WSI from 36 patients, referred to as the Stanford- HCCDET dataset.\nThis dataset was used to develop a model for automatically detecting tumor-containing tiles in a WSI (““DET”\nstands for “detection”). Use of all patient material and data was approved by the Stanford University Institutional\nReview Board, with waived informed consent.\n\nIn addition to the Stanford-HCC and Stanford-HCCDET datasets, a publicly-available dataset of 379 FFPE\ndiagnostic WSI from 365 unique patients in the TCGA-LIHC diagnostic slide collection were downloaded via\nthe GDC Data Portal” and used to develop the risk score prediction model for this study. The same patient\ndemographics, clinicopathologic variables, and RFI as collected for Stanford-HCC were obtained through\nreview of the accompanying metadata and pathology reports downloaded from the GDC Data Portal and the\npreviously-published Integrated TCGA Pan-Cancer Clinical Data Resource by Liu et al.*? RFI was defined as\nthe period from the date of surgery until the date of the first occurrence of a new tumor event, which included\nprogression of HCC, locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis, new primary tumor, or death with tumor”.\nPatients who were alive without these events, or who died without tumor, were censored”!. The event time was\nthe shortest period from the date of surgery to the date of an event. The censored time was the period from the\ndate of surgery to the date of last contact with the patient or the date of death without HCC. Given multiple\nchanges to the AJCC classification over the time period during which these specimens were collected (resulting\nin differences in the pathologic staging criteria across different editions of the AJCC), a reference pathologist\ntrained in the interpretation of hepatobiliary pathology (J.S.) reviewed the WSI and the downloaded pathology\nreports, in order to re-stage all of the patients based on the most current AJCC (8th edition) classification®. WSI\nscanned at 20 x base magnification were excluded (n=10 WSI, from 4 patients). One patient (n=1 WSI) with\nmissing RFI was excluded. Seven patients (n= 7 WSI) with mixed HCC-cholangiocarcinomas and one patient\n(n=1 WSJ) with an angiomyolipoma were excluded from the dataset. The final dataset (n = 360 WSI, from 352\npatients), referred to as the TCGA-HCC dataset, contained patients from 35 institutions, each with potentially\ndifferent staining and scanning protocols. The TCGA-HCC dataset was randomly split into the development\ncohort (n= 299 patients: n = 247 patients for training and n=52 patients for validation) and internal test cohort\n(n=53 patients), with no patient overlap between the splits.\n"

The performance of the tumor tile\nclassification model was assessed using the overall accuracy and AUROC. Model outputs for tiles with a ground\ntruth of tumor were compared with those for tiles with a ground truth of non-tumor, using the Wilcoxon rank\nsum test. We evaluated the performance of the risk score model using Harrell’s* and Unos*® c-indices, which\nindicate better prediction when their values approach one. Each patient was stratified into one of two subgroups\n(high-risk and low-risk), based on their patient-level risk score. The median risk score on the validation set from\nTCGA-HCC was used as the threshold for patient stratification (Supplementary Fig. 1). Kaplan-Meier analysis\nwas performed, and a log-rank test was used to compare the survival distributions between the subgroups.\nUnivariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the relationship between\nindependent variables and RFI. The independent variables included HCC-SurvNet's risk score, age at surgical\nresection, gender, AJCC stage grouping, largest tumor diameter, tumor multifocality, histologic tumor grade,\nmicrovascular invasion, macrovascular invasion, surgical margin status, fibrosis stage, and history of Hepatitis\nB, Hepatitis C, alcohol intake, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Of these, variables with univariable p values\nof less than 0.1 on either the internal or external test sets were selected for inclusion in the multivariable analysis.\nThe proportional hazards assumption was checked using Schoenfeld’s global test. To demonstrate the non-linear\nrelationship between HCC-SurvNet’s risk score and the log relative hazard for RFI, univariable Cox proportional\nhazards regression analysis with restricted cubic splines (3 knots) was performed. To account for potential intra-\nclass correlation among WSI prepared and scanned at the same institution within the TCGA cohort, a mixed-\neffect Cox regression model was constructed using the institution as a random effect. Spearman's correlation\ncoefficients were computed to gain insight into associations between the HCC-SurvNet risk score and differ-\nent patient characteristics in the external test (Stanford-HCC) cohort. Harrell’s c-index was compared between\nHCC-SurvNet’s risk score and the standard AJCC staging system, using a paired t-test.\n"
