This study explored a deep learning solution to detect\nbiologically important features that distinguish prognostic subgroups. A novel architec-\nture of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained with a customised objective function\n(Lesc) was developed. The ANN should discover new data representations, to detect\npatient subgroups that are biologically homogenous (clustering loss) and similar in sur-\nvival (survival loss) while removing noise from the data (reconstruction loss). The model\nwas applied to TCGA-HCC multi-omics data and benchmarked against baseline models\nthat only use a reconstruction objective function (BCE, MSE) for learning. With the base-\nline models, the new features are then filtered based on survival information and used\nfor clustering patients. Different variants of the customised objective function, incorpo-\nrating only reconstruction and clustering losses (Lp-); and reconstruction and survival\nlosses (Lgs) were also evaluated. Robust features consistently detected were compared\nbetween models and validated in TCGA and LIRI-JP HCC cohorts.\n"

Identifying patient subgroups that\nstratify by survival due to biological differences will be a step forward towards this goal.\nThis information could in future enable precision medicine whereby patients, when pro-\nfiled using omics technologies, are stratified into subgroups and have their treatments\ntailored accordingly.

This scenario necessitates the development of\nnew analytical solutions that harness the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to reveal\nnew information. Deep learning has been explored for patient subgroup identification\nin different cancers using high-dimensional multi-omics data [4, 5]. Chaudhary et al.\napplied deep learning in the area of HCC [6] to identify significantly different survival\nsubgroups using autoencoders. Autoencoders are feedforward neural networks which\ncan be used to learn a new representation of data, typically for dimensionality reduc-\ntion. They encode their input into a latent space and then decode this latent representa-\ntion as their output. The latent space can be used for further analysis, such as clustering\npatients into groups and identifying key features. Autoencoders have proven popular in\nbioinformatics as they can integrate multiple omics and data types [5, 6]. Autoencoder\ntransformation can often aggregate genes by pathway, which is useful for biological\ninterpretation and revealing the underlying patterns [7].\n"

The\nmotivation for considering both metrics (together with the autoencoder reconstruction\nloss) in the training process was to obtain groups of patients which are distinct in terms\nof survival and that are biologically insightful. Methods are applied in HCC, a disease\nthat is very heterogeneous and complex due to diverse risk factors. The autoencoder\narchitecture used by Chaudhary et al. [6] for multi-omics data analysis is used as a state-\nof-the-art baseline. The baseline first trains a standard autoencoder model and then uti-\nlises survival information to filter bottleneck features, which are further used for patient\nclustering. In our work, autoencoder architectures were explored that incorporated\nsurvival-based and clustering-based losses directly into the loss function of an autoen-\ncoder model. The losses were examined separately and combined together as a hybrid\nmodel. Evaluation of the five different models and their cluster quality was performed\nusing the Silhouette score and with survival analysis via the log-rank test statistic. The\nhybrid model proved to be a superior method as it identified significantly different prog-\nnostic groups that were far more homogeneous than those of the baseline models. Prog-\nnostic groups were distinguished by a large number of features that were consistently\nidentified by the hybrid model. Many of these robust features were novel compared to\nthe other losses and a proportion could be validated as prognostic in two HCC cohorts,\nthereby indicating their biological relevance and potential for therapeutic applications as\nbiomarkers or targets. This new information increases our understanding of the aetiol-\nogy of this heterogeneous disease. Potentially in future it may also improve the clinical\ndiagnosis and treatment of HCC implementing a precision medicine approach.\n"

Before identifying the key fea-\ntures differentiating clusters, the three omics sets initially underwent a two-step scaling\nprocess, like that used in the baseline [6]. First, all omics types underwent median norm\nscaling. RNA-seq and methylation then underwent robust scaling using the RobustScaler\nfrom Scikit-learn [16], with miRNA undergoing unit norm scaling. An analysis of vari-\nance (ANOVA) was then performed with the f_oneway function from scipy [20]. Ran-\ndomness introduced by factors such as the initialisation of weights could lead to slightly\ndifferent cluster labels being identified and therefore different top features being selected\neach time the pipeline is run. For this reason, the entire pipeline was run 10 times for\neach model, with clusters being evaluated and top features derived. To derive top fea-\ntures from the ANOVA, the P-values were sorted from smallest to largest for each omics\ntype. Of the top 10% of features, only those that had a significant P-value following cor-\nrection for multiple testing of ten runs using Bonferroni (P-value < 0.005) were selected.\nFor RNA-seq, 10% of features before filtering for significance was approximately 1561,\nfor methylation this was approximately 1899 and for miRNA this was approximately 42.\nThe top features identified by each of the ten runs of the different models were com-\npared, and frequently identified features in six, eight and all ten runs quantified. While\nsome features may have been identified by a small number of runs in a number of losses,\nthe focus was on those features that were consistently identified. Thus, a feature was des-\nignated as robust if it was consistently identified i.e. it appeared as a top feature in all 10\nruns for a loss. The robust omics features that were consistently identified as top features\nfor each loss were compared to see if there were any features consistently detected by\nLesc that were not consistently identified by the other losses. The consistently identified\nomics features from each loss were also compared with the top omics features identified\nby the baseline paper’s ANOVA as these differed from the recreation in this work.\n"

In all,\n29 of the 75 (38.67%) mRNA features significant for prognosis in the TCGA cohort\nwere also significant in the LIRI-JP cohort. The complexity of underlying risk factors\nof the HCC patients in the different cohorts may have accounted for why only a pro-\nportion of features could be validated as prognostic in both cohorts. A total of 15\nrobust miRNAs were also identified by the hybrid model. Of the two miRNA features\nof interest that were novel, hsa-let-7g has been linked to inhibition of HCC cells pro-\nliferation [25]. The other novel miRNA identified, hsa-mir-550a-1, has not previously\nbeen linked with HCC and would warrant experimental investigation perhaps. Of the\n328 methylation features consistently identified by Lg.c, 233 were significant for prog-\nnosis. Some of these genes have been previously linked with HCC, including RIC-\nTOR, which was found to be dysregulated in cancers, including HCC [26].\n"

In this work,\na single Gene-enrichment and Functional Annotation Analysis was conducted on the\nfeatures that were most different between clusters. The reason for this was to focus on\nuncovering the biological pathways that differed between prognostic patient groups.\nPrognostic subgroups for the losses did not appear to be explained by clinical charac-\nteristics such as disease grade or risk factors. Instead many of the robust features identi-\nfied by the hybrid model that distinguished prognostic groups were novel and had not\nbeen previously described for HCC by similar models. Thus, further investigation of the\nrobust features that distinguished prognostic groups could determine whether any of\nthese genomic alterations that distinguished patients in groups would be of interest from\na clinical perspective for diagnosing new HCC survival subtypes.\n"
