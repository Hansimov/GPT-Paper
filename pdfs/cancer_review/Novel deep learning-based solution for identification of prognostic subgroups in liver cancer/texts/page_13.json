Size split between clusters dif-\nfered between models. BCE, MSE and Lac all had a relatively even split in group sizes,\nwhich were 158 v 194, 181 v 171 and 169 v 183, respectively (Figs. 5A, B, D). The sur-\nvival-based loss produced a more uneven split (302 v 50) compared to that created by\nthe Lpsc loss (271 v 81). In general, those losses which included L, had a more uneven\nsplit in group sizes compared to the other losses. Cluster membership for all models did\nnot have any evidence that they related to HCC disease grade or risk factors (Table 3).\n"

A hazard ratio of one suggests that\nthere was no difference in survival between groups. Hazard ratios for all of the 100 bot-\ntleneck features produced by the combined loss Lesc differed greatly from one (range:\n2.29E—45 to 2.82E+45; Additional file 1: Table $1). This provided evidence that all the\nLrsc bottleneck features were highly explanatory for HCC survival and conveyed either\na massively increased risk, or a massively reduced risk. This indicated that by using the\ncombined loss we can learn a new joint representation of the multi-omics data that is\nhighly informative for the task of prognostic subgroups identification. Using the new\ndata representation (i.e. bottleneck features), we were able to identify new subgroups\nwith greater differences in survival (log-rank P-value) and more biologically meaningful\n(Silhouette score) in comparison to the baseline.\n"
