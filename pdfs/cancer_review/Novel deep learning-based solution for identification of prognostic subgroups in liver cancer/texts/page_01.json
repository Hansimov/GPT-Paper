            "text": "Background: Liver cancer (Hepatocellular carcinoma; HCC) prevalence is increas-\n\ning and with poor clinical outcome expected it means greater understanding of HCC\naetiology is urgently required. This study explored a deep learning solution to detect\nbiologically important features that distinguish prognostic subgroups. A novel architec-\nture of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained with a customised objective function\n(Lesc) was developed. The ANN should discover new data representations, to detect\npatient subgroups that are biologically homogenous (clustering loss) and similar in sur-\nvival (survival loss) while removing noise from the data (reconstruction loss). The model\nwas applied to TCGA-HCC multi-omics data and benchmarked against baseline models\nthat only use a reconstruction objective function (BCE, MSE) for learning. With the base-\nline models, the new features are then filtered based on survival information and used\nfor clustering patients. Different variants of the customised objective function, incorpo-\nrating only reconstruction and clustering losses (Lp-); and reconstruction and survival\nlosses (Lgs) were also evaluated. Robust features consistently detected were compared\nbetween models and validated in TCGA and LIRI-JP HCC cohorts.\n"

All Lgg- bottleneck features (N = 100)\nwere significant for survival, compared to only 11-21 for baseline models. Prognostic\nsubgroups were not explained by disease grade or risk factors. Instead Lpcc identified\nrobust features including 377 mRNAs, many of which were novel (61.27%) compared\nto those identified by the other losses. Some 75 mRNAs were prognostic in TCGA,\nwhile 29 were prognostic in LIRI-JP also. Lycc also identified 15 robust miRNAs including\ntwo novel (hsa-let-7g; hsa-mir-550a-1) and 328 methylation features with 71% being\nprognostic. Gene-enrichment and Functional Annotation Analysis identified seven\npathways differentiating prognostic clusters.\n"
