            "text": "Cluster quality metrics were compared between models (Table 2). The clusters obtained\nby the baseline models BCE and MSE had lower Silhouette scores (0.18—0.31), indicat-\ning poorer cluster quality, i.e. more heterogeneous. For BCE and MSE, the number of\nsignificant bottleneck features to be used in clustering following filtering, as identified by\nthe univariate Cox models, was quite low and ranged from 11 to 21 out of the bottleneck\ndimension of 100. By comparison, some of the highest Silhouette scores were achieved\nby Lec, demonstrating that the k-means inspired loss produced better quality clusters\ncompared to the other losses. This provided greater confidence in sample assignment to\nclusters by the Lpc and indicated that they comprised of more homogeneous and conse-\nquently more biologically meaningful groupings. For loss functions using L¢, the bottle-\nneck layer was clustered according to group labels derived after each epoch. For Lpyc and\nLysc, the Silhouette score of the bottleneck improves as epochs increase (Fig. 4). With\nthe heavy influence of L; the ascent of the Silhouette score in Lpc (Fig. 4A) is smoother\nthan Lesc (Fig. 4B). The Silhouette score steadily rises with continued training with Lec,\nthereby indicating a continuous improvement in sample assignment for both models.\n"
