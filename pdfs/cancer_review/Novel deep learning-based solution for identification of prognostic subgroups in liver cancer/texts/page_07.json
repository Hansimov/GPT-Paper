Coefficients describe\nthe effect size of a particular variable, with positive 6 suggesting a worse prognosis\nand negative 6 suggesting a protective effect for that variable. For example, in a Cox\nmodel a positive coefficient for a variable such as age could mean that increasing age\nresults in poorer prognosis. In Le, W'@(x;) represents the single scaler output for the\ninput of sample i from the single dimension branch stemming from the bottleneck\nlayer.
