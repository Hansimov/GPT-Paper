Only those samples which had\nall three omics types, a non-negative survival value and a histologic diagnosis of HCC\nwere selected. For each omics type, features which had either a missing or zero value in\nmore than 20% of samples were removed. Next, those samples which had more than 20%\nof their features missing or of zero value were removed. The impute.knn function in the\nimpute R package was used to fill in any missing values [12]. Following pre-processing, a\ntotal of 352 samples were taken forward for further analyses.\n"
