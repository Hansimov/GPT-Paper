The flowchart demonstrates how multi-omics data is\ncombined into a single matrix, before being transformed by the autoencoder to produce bottleneck features.\nIf the loss is BCE or MSE these bottleneck features are reduced by univariate Cox models as in the baseline\nbefore clustering to create group labels. For Lc and Lecc group labels from the final iteration of autoencoder\ntraining are used whereas for Lg, group labels are derived by clustering all bottleneck features. Using the\nidentified cluster labels the top original omics features are identified for the run using ANOVA\n"
