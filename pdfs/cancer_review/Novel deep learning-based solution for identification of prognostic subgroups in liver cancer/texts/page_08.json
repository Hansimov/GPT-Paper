Pseudocode of the\ntraining using Lpsc is shown in Fig. 2. For all losses the entire dataset was used during\nthe training and predicting phases. Loss stabilisation occurred at around 40 epochs for\nLec» Lys and Lesc so this was considered to be optimal for these losses. After autoen-\ncoder training, the entire matrix was passed through the trained autoencoder’s encoder\nfunction to produce a 352 x 100 matrix, a bottleneck vector for each sample.\n"
