In all,\n29 of the 75 (38.67%) mRNA features significant for prognosis in the TCGA cohort\nwere also significant in the LIRI-JP cohort. The complexity of underlying risk factors\nof the HCC patients in the different cohorts may have accounted for why only a pro-\nportion of features could be validated as prognostic in both cohorts. A total of 15\nrobust miRNAs were also identified by the hybrid model. Of the two miRNA features\nof interest that were novel, hsa-let-7g has been linked to inhibition of HCC cells pro-\nliferation [25]. The other novel miRNA identified, hsa-mir-550a-1, has not previously\nbeen linked with HCC and would warrant experimental investigation perhaps. Of the\n328 methylation features consistently identified by Lg.c, 233 were significant for prog-\nnosis. Some of these genes have been previously linked with HCC, including RIC-\nTOR, which was found to be dysregulated in cancers, including HCC [26].\n"
