A) Whole-\nslide images were first cut into small image patches of tissue (“tiles”), and features were extracted\nfrom these tiles by a pretrained convolutional neural network. This preprocessing step was\nidentical for CHOWDER and SCHMOWDER. B) CHOWDER is a neural network that predicts a\nrisk score from WSls, without the need for local annotations. Tile features are fed into the network\nalong with survival data, and a risk score is assigned to each tile through an iterative learning\nprocess. The network then selects the 25 tiles with the highest and lowest scores for the\nprediction of patient survival. One of the key features of CHOWDER is its interpretability, as the\nmost predictive tiles can be extracted and reviewed. C) SCHMOWDER is a two-branch neural\nnetwork combining an unsupervised branch (lower part) and a supervised attention mechanism\n(upper part). Using annotations provided by the pathologist (JC), the upper branch is trained to\ndetermine whether each tile is tumoral or non-tumoral. By assigning a tumoral score to each tile\nand applying an attention mechanism to these scores, the upper branch generates a\nrepresentation of tiles with a high probability of being tumoral. The lower branch, like CHOWDER,\nis weakly supervised and generates a representation of a small number of tiles that are the most\npredictive of survival. Representations from the two branches are merged and a Survival risk is\ncalculated.\n"
