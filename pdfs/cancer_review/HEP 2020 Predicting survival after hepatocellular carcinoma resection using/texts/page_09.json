We used the risk score assigned to\neach patient by CHOWDER and SCHMOWDER to stratify the population into two subgroups. The\nmedian risk score of each model was used as a threshold for stratifying patients into low and\nhigh-risk subgroups. Our models stratified the population more accurately than the CS or any\nother clinical or pathological variable (HR=4.0, p=1.1e-6 and HR=5.38, p=5.2e-9 and HR=5.72,\np=4.4e-9 for the CS, CHOWDER and SCHMOWDER,, respectively) (Figure 3B and 4). The risk\nscore computed by SCHMOWDER was of independent prognostic value (p=3.10-5), and\npredicted survival even after stratification for other features (such as BCLC disease stage,\nsatellite nodules, AFP serum level, vascular invasion) (Figure 4). These observations\ndemonstrate that the model captures complex patterns non-redundant with baseline variables\nknown to affect survival in patients with HCC.\n"

Clinical, biological, and pathological data were downloaded from\nthe database, together with digital slides (9-11). In total, 328 patients met the inclusion criteria\nused for the discovery set (Supplemental Table 2 and Methods), and 115 deaths were recorded\namong these patients. Overall survival was significantly lower than that for the discovery set\n(median of 58 months vs. 91 months, p=0.02). The slides had been treated by different staining\nprotocols and were encoded in a different format from the discovery set (they were also collected\nfrom different clinical centers). The following variables were available and included in the\nanalysis: disease stage according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), age at\ndiagnosis, sex, serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP), alcohol consumption, HBV (hepatitis B virus) or\nHCV infection, other etiologies, undetermined etiology, tumor differentiation according to the\nWorld Health Organization criteria, macrovascular and microvascular invasion, positive surgical\nmargins, and non-tumoral liver fibrosis (cirrhosis). The clinical, biological and pathological\nfeatures associated with shorter survival were AJCC stage (HR=2.35, p=1.6E-5), and\nundetermined etiology (HR=1.97, p=3.8E-3) (Figure 5). As for the discovery set, a CS integrating\nrelevant baseline variables was calculated (Figure 5).\n"
