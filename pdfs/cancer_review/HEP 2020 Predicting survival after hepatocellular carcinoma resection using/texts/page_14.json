            "text": "atypia.(17, 18) We also identified a new feature, the presence of vascular spaces, as strongly\nlinked to a high risk of poor overall survival. This observation suggests that the vascular\narchitecture of HCC is a key determinant of the aggressiveness of this cancer, warranting further\nbiological research. It is also consistent with previous histological and biological studies showing\nan association between pro-angiogenic phenotype and poor clinical outcome.(19-22) An analysis\nof tiles extracted from the non-tumoral liver yielded unexpected results, with an enrichment in\nfibrosis and inflammatory infiltrates, features commonly related to severe liver disease, in tiles\nclassified as low risk.(23) However, this model may have identified a particular type of fibrosis\nthat can regress and immune cell subsets preventing liver damage. We thus believe that\ndisrupting new scientific hypotheses can be generated with models of this type, facilitating\nanalyses of the most important features affecting tile classification.\n"
