In this study, we used two deep-learning\nalgorithms based on whole-slide digitized histological slides (WSI) to build models for predicting\nthe survival of patients with HCC treated by surgical resection. Two independent series were\ninvestigated: a discovery set (Henri Mondor Hospital, n=194) used to develop our algorithms and\nan independent validation set (TCGA, n=328). WSls were first divided into small squares (\"tiles\")\nand features were extracted with a pretrained convolutional neural network (preprocessing step).\n"

In the discovery set, c-indexes for survival prediction of SCHMOWDER and\nCHOWDER reached 0.78 and 0.75, respectively. Both models outperformed a composite score\nincorporating all baseline variables associated with survival. The prognostic value of the models\nwas further validated in the TCGA dataset, and, as observed in the discovery series, both models\nhad a higher discriminatory power than a score combining all baseline variables associated with\nsurvival. Pathological review showed that the tumoral areas most predictive of poor survival were\ncharacterized by vascular spaces, the macrotrabecular architectural pattern and a lack of immune\ninfiltration.\n"
