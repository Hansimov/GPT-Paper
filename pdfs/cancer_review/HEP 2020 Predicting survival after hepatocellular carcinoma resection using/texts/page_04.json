            "text": "In most human cancers, prognosis is strongly related to pathological criteria.(2) Indeed, the\nhistological analysis of tumor tissues provides crucial information for the stratification of patients\nand treatment  allocation.(2) The recent development of slide digitization and\ncomputational/mathematical image processing promises to improve and standardize various\npathological and morphological analyses, and may also facilitate the extraction of “hidden”\nimaging features potentially providing useful clinical and/or biological information.(3) In a recent\npioneering study simulating routine pathology workflows, a subset of deep learning-based\nalgorithms outperformed a panel of 11 pathologists at detecting lymph node metastases of breast\ncancers.(4) Coudray and coworkers have also shown that neural networks applied on whole-slide\ndigitized histological images (WSls) can diagnose the main histological subtypes of non-small cell\nlung cancer and predict the mutational status of various genes (e.g. STK11, EGFR).(5) There is\ngrowing evidence to suggest that the computational processing of WSls will refine the prediction\nof patient prognosis, thereby improving treatment allocation.(6, 7) Yu and coworkers have\ndemonstrated that digital image analysis software can extract significant prognostic features from\nhematein and eosin-stained slides in lung cancer.(6) Convolutional neural networks have also\nbeen reported to predict the aggressiveness of various human malignancies.(7, 8)\n"

By analyzing\nareas classified as “low-risk” and “high-risk” by our model, we were able to obtain insight into the\nmost relevant features used by the network for patient stratification.\n"
