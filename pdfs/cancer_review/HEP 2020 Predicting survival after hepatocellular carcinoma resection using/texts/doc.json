Finally, the\nnetwork selects a small number of tiles with the highest and lowest survival scores for the\nprediction of patient survival (Figure 2B). The architecture of CHOWDER was designed to\nretrieve the most predictive tiles from the thousands processed for further analysis by\npathologists.\n\nSCHMOWDER is a two-branch neural network combining an unsupervised component and a\nsupervised attention mechanism (Figure 2C). The preprocessing step is identical to that of\nCHOWDER. Annotations provided by the pathologist are then used to train the upper branch to\nidentify tiles as tumoral or non-tumoral. By assigning a tumor score to each tile and applying an\nattention mechanism to these scores, the upper branch generates a representation of tiles with a\nhigh probability of being tumoral. The lower branch is weakly supervised and generates a\nrepresentation of only a small number of tiles, the most predictive of survival. Representations\nfrom the two branches are merged to generate a survival risk as output.\n\nThis “expert-driven” approach, using annotations during training, thus combines two views of the\nWSI to improve the prediction of survival: a supervised approach focusing on tumoral areas, and\na weakly supervised approach not dependent on prior knowledge. The lower branch focuses on\nvery localized areas of the WSI, whereas the upper branch gathers information from broader\nareas (all tiles located in tumoral regions). We believe that this approach enables the model to\ncapture survival-related information from both tumoral and non-tumoral tissues. Local annotations\nare needed during training, but not for inference; so, once trained, SCHMOWDER can be used\non slides for which no annotations are available (such as those of the TCGA dataset).\n"

As expected liver\nfunction was preserved in almost all the patients (191/194 were classified as Child-Pugh A). We\ndid not, therefore, include this variable in the analysis. The frequency of cirrhosis was also low\n(Supplemental Table 1). Fifty-six deaths were recorded during follow-up (after a median follow\nup of 26.5 months). The clinical and pathological features associated with shorter overall survival\nwere microvascular invasion (hazard ratio (HR)=4.2, p=5E-7), BCLC stage B-C (HR=4.1, p=6E-6)\nand macrovascular invasion (HR=3.7, p=4E-5).\n\nOne or two representative digital slides of hematein-eosin-saffron (HES)-stained sections were\navailable for each HCC case (NDPI format, 40x magnification, total of 390 slides from 206\ntumors; some patients had several tumors). These slides included tissues from both the HCC and\nthe adjacent surrounding liver tissues, and the tumor and non-tumoral areas were identified and\nannotated by an expert liver pathologist (JC).\n\nWe extracted 20 000 tiles (small image patches of 224 x 224 pixels) from each available WSI\n(total of 7 800 000 tiles), and used a pretrained convolutional neural network to extract relevant\nfeatures from each tile before training our models (Figure 2A, Supplemental Methods).(14)\n\nWe assessed the discriminatory power of the CHOWDER and SCHMOWDER models for\npredicting overall survival by cross-validation. We found that both models performed well, with\nmean c-indexes of 0.75 and 0.78, respectively (Figure 3A). Interestingly, both models\noutperformed baseline variables (Figure 3A). We then constructed a composite score (CS)\nintegrating the relevant clinical, biological and pathological features for survival prediction, and\nshowed that both deep learning-based models had a greater discriminatory power than the CS\n(Figure 3A and Supplementary Methods).\n"

The slides had been treated by different staining\nprotocols and were encoded in a different format from the discovery set (they were also collected\nfrom different clinical centers). The following variables were available and included in the\nanalysis: disease stage according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), age at\ndiagnosis, sex, serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP), alcohol consumption, HBV (hepatitis B virus) or\nHCV infection, other etiologies, undetermined etiology, tumor differentiation according to the\nWorld Health Organization criteria, macrovascular and microvascular invasion, positive surgical\nmargins, and non-tumoral liver fibrosis (cirrhosis). The clinical, biological and pathological\nfeatures associated with shorter survival were AJCC stage (HR=2.35, p=1.6E-5), and\nundetermined etiology (HR=1.97, p=3.8E-3) (Figure 5). As for the discovery set, a CS integrating\nrelevant baseline variables was calculated (Figure 5).\n"

Indeed, our models outperformed all other common clinical or pathological features for\npredicting survival. Slides from the TCGA dataset were indeed processed as they were, without\nthe annotation of tumoral or non-tumoral areas or the removal of artifacts (e.g. blurring,\nannotation markers or folds). Slide formats and staining protocols also differed between the two\nseries of slides (NDPI format and hematein-eosin-saffron staining for the discovery set and SVS\nformat and hematein-eosin staining for the validation set). These findings demonstrate the\nrobustness of our models and suggest that they may be suitable for use in different technical\nsettings. However, both models performed less well on the validation set, for which the prognostic\npower of classical clinical and pathological variables was also lower (difference in c-indexes and\nhazard ratio values between our dataset and the TCGA). This may be explained by the lower\noverall survival of the patients from the TCGA dataset. We cannot however exclude an overfitting\nissue during the development of the model in the training set. Indeed, features specific of the\ndiscovery set (such as noise related to the staining techniques or slides format) are likely to be\nalso incorporated by the neural networks in the decision process and may thus impact the\nperformance on external and new datasets. This is particularly true for image analysis, and the\nimitation of this phenomenon is an active area of research. Data augmentation approaches,\nwhich artificially inflate the training set size by data transformation and/or oversampling, may be\nconsidered, however they significantly increase the computation time.\n"

Their model was able to\nidentify two distinct subgroups of patients with significant survival differences, and was further\nvalidated in five external cohorts. The implementation of these high-throughput gene expression\nprofiling/sequencing technologies in clinical care is however currently hampered by their cost, the\nneed for nucleic acid extraction, and standardization and reproducibility issues. Our model\nrequires only stained slides, which are easily available in a surgical treatment setting. We believe\nthat this approach would thus facilitate the implementation of risk stratification systems in clinical\npractice. The use of such models will however require particular workflows in pathology\ndepartments that allow efficient, rapid and reproducible glass slides scanning. The WSI\nprocessing and computing time should also be short enough not to delay therapeutic decisions.\nBoth our discovery and validation series consisted of patients treated by surgical resection for\nwhom abundant histological material is available, and the validation of our models in other clinical\nsettings remains a challenge for future studies.\n"

A) Whole-\nslide images were first cut into small image patches of tissue (“tiles”), and features were extracted\nfrom these tiles by a pretrained convolutional neural network. This preprocessing step was\nidentical for CHOWDER and SCHMOWDER. B) CHOWDER is a neural network that predicts a\nrisk score from WSls, without the need for local annotations. Tile features are fed into the network\nalong with survival data, and a risk score is assigned to each tile through an iterative learning\nprocess. The network then selects the 25 tiles with the highest and lowest scores for the\nprediction of patient survival. One of the key features of CHOWDER is its interpretability, as the\nmost predictive tiles can be extracted and reviewed. C) SCHMOWDER is a two-branch neural\nnetwork combining an unsupervised branch (lower part) and a supervised attention mechanism\n(upper part). Using annotations provided by the pathologist (JC), the upper branch is trained to\ndetermine whether each tile is tumoral or non-tumoral. By assigning a tumoral score to each tile\nand applying an attention mechanism to these scores, the upper branch generates a\nrepresentation of tiles with a high probability of being tumoral. The lower branch, like CHOWDER,\nis weakly supervised and generates a representation of a small number of tiles that are the most\npredictive of survival. Representations from the two branches are merged and a Survival risk is\ncalculated.\n"
