Tiles\nwith high and low risk scores were thus extracted and further analyzed by a pathologist expert in\nliver disease (J.C). He was blinded to the risk scores associated with each tile. In total, 27\nhistological features of tumoral and non-tumoral liver tissues were systematically recorded\n(Supplemental Figure 1).\n"
