As for the discovery set, both models\noutperformed all the other available features and the CS integrating all relevant baseline\ncharacteristics. The CS indeed gave a mean c-index of 0.63, which represents a 26% increase\nwith respect to a random prediction, while CHOWDER and SCHMOWDER featured an increase\nof 36% (p=3.6e-5) and 40% (p=3.4e-9), respectively. (Figure 5A). SCHMOWDER significantly\noutperformed CHOWDER (p=4.5E-2) and was an independent prognostic factor (p=3.2E-7). We\nused the threshold established with the discovery set to classify patients into high and low-risk\nsubclasses. This classification stratified the population of the validation set more effectively than\nthe CS or any other variable (HR=2.6, p=3.2E-7 and HR=4.3, p=2.5E-12 and HR=3.4, p=5.3E-11\nfor the CS, CHOWDER and SCHMOWDER,, respectively) (Figure 5B).\n"

            "text": "The architecture of CHOWDER enables it to retrieve the most predictive tiles from among the\nthousands processed. We investigated the main histological determinants of survival, by\nextracting the 400 most predictive tiles (high risk of death: 200, low risk of death: 200) from 245\nWSlIs with CHOWDER and having them reviewed by a pathologist with expertise in liver disease\nand tumors (JC). Nineteen histological features were recorded in tumoral areas, and the features\nmost predictive of a high risk of death were the presence of vascular spaces (p=1.3E-10), a\nmacrotrabecular architectural pattern (p=8.6E-5), a high degree of cytological atypia (p=1.4E-8)\nand nuclear hyperchomasia (p=1.4E-8). In both tumoral and non-tumoral areas, fibrosis and\nimmune cells were associated with a low risk score (p=1.1E-3 and 3.4E-8, respectively) (Figure\n7). Overall, these results demonstrate that our deep learning model can detect both known and\nnovel histological patterns associated with survival in HCC patients.\n"
