            "text": "The major difference between the two neural networks used in this study was the inclusion of an\nattention mechanism in SCHMOWDER. Whole-slide images contain large amounts of\ninformation, not all of which is relevant to the prediction of survival. Our model acts in a similar\nway to pathologists analyzing images to make a diagnosis. It focuses on specific areas of the\nslide identified as potentially containing key survival-related information. Indeed we hypothesized\nthat the most important features for survival prediction were located in the tumoral areas, and we\nshowed that the addition of this attention mechanism significantly improved the performance of\nthe model. Once trained, these networks no longer require annotation, as they can automatically\nidentify the regions of interest on slides. These results highlight the importance of human-\nmachine interactions for the development of artificial intelligence-based algorithms.\n"

            "text": "Several studies based on gene expression profiling and/or genetic testing have reported scores\npredicting the survival of patients with HCC.(15) In a recent and elegant study, Chaudhary and\ncollaborators used deep-learning approaches on RNA/miRNA sequencing and methylation data\nfrom the TCGA database to predict prognosis after HCC resection. Their model was able to\nidentify two distinct subgroups of patients with significant survival differences, and was further\nvalidated in five external cohorts. The implementation of these high-throughput gene expression\nprofiling/sequencing technologies in clinical care is however currently hampered by their cost, the\nneed for nucleic acid extraction, and standardization and reproducibility issues. Our model\nrequires only stained slides, which are easily available in a surgical treatment setting. We believe\nthat this approach would thus facilitate the implementation of risk stratification systems in clinical\npractice. The use of such models will however require particular workflows in pathology\ndepartments that allow efficient, rapid and reproducible glass slides scanning. The WSI\nprocessing and computing time should also be short enough not to delay therapeutic decisions.\nBoth our discovery and validation series consisted of patients treated by surgical resection for\nwhom abundant histological material is available, and the validation of our models in other clinical\nsettings remains a challenge for future studies.\n"
