The prognostic pathological features identified in\ndigital WSIs composed a computable index to discriminate\npatients in terms of their relapse risk. The new model derived\nby weakly supervised training facilitated the classification\nprocess of typical HCC tissues, depicted the immune\ninfiltration condition in intratumoral and peritumoral\nstructures, and highlighted the clinical characteristics that were\nsignificant to prognosis. Further AI research may pay attention\nto interpretation at the cellular level and the integration of\ntherapeutic decisions or multiomics sequencing.\n"
