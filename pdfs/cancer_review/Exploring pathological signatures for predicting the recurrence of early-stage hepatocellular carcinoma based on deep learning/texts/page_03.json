(A) The recurrence-related scores were first developed and internally validated in a series of\npatients with BCLC stage O-A treated by curative resection at Zhongshan Hospital. The scores were then externally validated by TNM-| stage\npatients in the TCGA cohort. (B) We first developed the neural network using 116 whole-slide images (WSls) as the category-based training data.\nThe network was then used to analyze the remaining WSls and generate the classification maps. Pathological image features were extracted\nfrom typical tiles. Next, we constructed two recurrence prediction scores via LASSO-Cox. CS was composed of clinical and histological\ncharacteristics. HS was developed based on pure histological features. Finally, we analyzed the model discrimination ability, patient prognosis\nand local immune cell infiltration. TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas; PR, precision-recall; CS, combined score; HS, histological score; TPR, true\npositive rate; FPR, false positive rate.\n"
