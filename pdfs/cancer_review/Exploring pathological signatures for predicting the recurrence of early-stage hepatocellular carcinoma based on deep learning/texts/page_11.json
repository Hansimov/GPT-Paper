In the present research, we manually input abundant\nsignatures of the most relevant tiles, automatically screened the\nsignatures with the recurrence time as the labels via LASSO Cox\nregression, and visually presented the weight of each signature.\nThis procedure bypassed the need for the manual recognition of\nnumerous postprocess tiles. In addition, the image signatures\nthat came from empirical utilization ensured the feasibility\n(36, 37).\n"

            "text": "Compared to reported studies, our study has advantages in\nterms of multicategory training, heatmap visualization, a more\naccurate prediction of recurrence and multifaceted analysis. HCC\nis highly heterogeneous with regard to not only genetics or\nepigenetics but also histology. Despite the classic histological\ncategories mentioned above, the portal area and lymphocyte area\nare also important structures. Recently, tertiary lymphoid structures\nwere proven to be a favorable factor for prognosis and recurrence\nstatus (38), and immune infiltration conditions are becoming more\ndeterminant in precision therapy (39). The portal area is a\nconnective tissue among hepatic lobules consisting of branches of\nthe hepatic artery, portal vein and hepatic ducts, in which lymphatic\nvessels and nerve fibers exist. It was reported that the number of\nportal areas and inflammation or iron deposition around the portal\narea were associated with the pathogenesis of HCC (40, 41). Herein,\nthese two structures were originally annotated and trained in the\nstudy. The AUC value for the portal area was 0.757, lower than that\nof the other five tissues, which could be caused by poor structural\npurity and inadequate amounts. Technically, modified image\nstandardization balanced the color differences among tiles, which\nraised the overall recognition accuracy for HCC structures up to\n94.17%. We also applied the CAM method to visualize the\nimportance of the local structure. As shown in Figure 2, cells\nattracted more attention for recurrence than cell-free areas such as\nfibrosis and necrosis areas, which made it easier for us to intuitively\nunderstand the microscopic information.\n"

Notably, a larger proportion of MTM-\nHCC was found in the HS high-risk group, indicating that\ninvisible information processed by deep learning could be\nexplained by the specific texture of tumor cells. In contrast to\nSaillard et al’s dissected tiles of MTM structures, we analyzed the\npathological subtype by a whole slide, which was closer to the\ndefinition of MTM-HCC (42). As a rare and highly malignant\ntumor subtype of HCC, MTM-HCC was proven to be correlated\nwith an increased recurrence risk and poor survival (42, 43). Our\nstudy supported this finding. Staining markers for pathological\nevaluation have gained increasing attention in postoperative\nmanagement. HSP70 is identified as an upregulated marker in\nHCC components and performs its role at several points of\napoptotic signaling (33). A significant difference was observed in\nthe expression of HSP70 between two risk subgroups, which was\nconsistent with the previous study (44).\n"
