Several treatments including surgery, locoregional\ntherapies, and immunotherapy have been adopted as standards of\ncare according to different tumor stages (2-4). Curative resection\noffers a chance of improved survival for HCC patients, especially\nthose with early-stage tumors that are defined as Barcelona Clinic\nLiver Cancer (BCLC) stages 0 and A (5). Although the 5-year\nsurvival rate can reach 70% in early-stage HCC patients (6), half\nof patients suffer recurrence after liver resection (7) due to the\nlack of approved adjuvant therapies. Therefore, the precise\nprediction of postoperative recurrence is urgently needed.\n"

Compared to\ntraditional staging systems, radiomics models also showed\nfavorable efficacy in the recurrence prediction of HCC patients\nwithin the Milan criteria (10). In terms of histological features,\nspecific structures such as microvascular invasion (MVI) and\ntumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were associated with recurrence\nrisk (11, 12). However, due to the high heterogeneity in HCC,\nvaluable information based on whole-slide images (WSIs) has\nnot been thoroughly detected. Furthermore, the correlation\nbetween pathological texture and recurrence remains unknown.\n"
