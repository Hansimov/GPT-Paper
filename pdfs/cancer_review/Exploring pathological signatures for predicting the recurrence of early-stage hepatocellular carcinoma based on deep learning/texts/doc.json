Similarly,\nCS performed well in the training and validation cohorts\n(Supplementary Figure S3). To further compare the prediction\nreliability between the new scores and traditional biomarkers and\nstages, we carried out ROC curve analysis based on the cases in the\ntraining and validation cohorts. In terms of 1-year RFS, the AUC\nvalues of HS and CS were 0.837 and 0.857, respectively, much\nhigher than those of clinical indicators such as AFP or liver\ncirrhosis, and the CNLC or BCLC staging systems (Figure 3D).\nThe AUC values of HS and CS reached 0.857 and 0.852 for 3-year\nRES prediction and 0.826 and 0.845 for 5-year RFS prediction,\nrespectively (Figures 3E, F).\n"

In the present research, we manually input abundant\nsignatures of the most relevant tiles, automatically screened the\nsignatures with the recurrence time as the labels via LASSO Cox\nregression, and visually presented the weight of each signature.\nThis procedure bypassed the need for the manual recognition of\nnumerous postprocess tiles.

HCC\nis highly heterogeneous with regard to not only genetics or\nepigenetics but also histology. Despite the classic histological\ncategories mentioned above, the portal area and lymphocyte area\nare also important structures. Recently, tertiary lymphoid structures\nwere proven to be a favorable factor for prognosis and recurrence\nstatus (38), and immune infiltration conditions are becoming more\ndeterminant in precision therapy (39). The portal area is a\nconnective tissue among hepatic lobules consisting of branches of\nthe hepatic artery, portal vein and hepatic ducts, in which lymphatic\nvessels and nerve fibers exist. It was reported that the number of\nportal areas and inflammation or iron deposition around the portal\narea were associated with the pathogenesis of HCC (40, 41). Herein,\nthese two structures were originally annotated and trained in the\nstudy. The AUC value for the portal area was 0.757, lower than that\nof the other five tissues, which could be caused by poor structural\npurity and inadequate amounts. Technically, modified image\nstandardization balanced the color differences among tiles, which\nraised the overall recognition accuracy for HCC structures up to\n94.17%. We also applied the CAM method to visualize the\nimportance of the local structure. As shown in Figure 2, cells\nattracted more attention for recurrence than cell-free areas such as\nfibrosis and necrosis areas, which made it easier for us to intuitively\nunderstand the microscopic information.\n"
