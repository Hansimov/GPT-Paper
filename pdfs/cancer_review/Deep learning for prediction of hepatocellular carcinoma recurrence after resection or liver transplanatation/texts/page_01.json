A nucleus map set\n(n= 120) was used to train U-net to capture the nuclear architecture. The training set (7 =552) included HCC patients that\nhad been treated by resection. The liver transplantation (LT) set (= 144) contained patients with HCC that had been treated\nby LT. The train set and its nuclear architectural information extracted by U-net were used to train the MobileNet V2-based\nclassifier (MobileNetV2_HCC_class). The classifier was then independently tested on the LT set and externally validated\non the TCGA set (n= 302). The primary outcome was recurrence free survival (RFS).\n"

The classifier provided\na hazard ratio of 3.44 (95% CI 2.01-5.87, p <0.001) for high risk versus low risk in the LT set, and 2.55 (95% CI 1.64—-3.99,\np <0.001) when known prognostic factors, remarkable in univariable analyses on the same cohort, were adjusted. The Mobile-\nNetV2_HCC_class maintained a relatively higher discriminatory power [time-dependent accuracy and area under curve\n(AUC)] than other factors after LT or resection in the independent validation set (LT and TCGA set). Net reclassification\nimprovement (NRI) analysis indicated MobileNetV2_HCC_class exhibited better net benefits for the Stage_AJCC beyond\nother independent factors. A pathological review demonstrated that tumoral areas with the highest recurrence predictability\nfeatured the following features: the presence of stroma, a high degree of cytological atypia, nuclear hyperchromasia, and a\nlack of immune cell infiltration.\n"
