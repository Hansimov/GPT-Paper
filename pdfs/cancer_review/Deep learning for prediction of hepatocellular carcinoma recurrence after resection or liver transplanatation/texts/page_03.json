All the tiles could be fed to train the\nlearning model. However, such an approach has serious\ndrawbacks during classification. In many cases, the con-\ntent of one small tile conflicts with the label of the original\npathological image, especially in HCC cases with great\nheterogeneity. To solve this problem, MobileNet V2 was\ndeveloped using MIL for training only on tile collections\nthat carried a label for the associated whole-slide image. In\nthis way, we could use MIL to take information on features\nfrom every tile. Instead of annotating each tile with its\nancestor’s label and dumping it into the network directly,\nwe packed all the tiles into a bag with a label identical to\nthe original pathological image. Each bag, which repre-\nsents one pathological image, was then passed through\na trained neural network to calculate the scores of each\ntile in the bag, and an aggregational function was used\nto produce a weight-average score for the whole bag. By\nsetting a threshold, the pathological image was classified\ninto a certain class.\n"
