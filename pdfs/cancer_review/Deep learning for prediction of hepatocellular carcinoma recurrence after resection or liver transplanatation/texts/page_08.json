            "text": "Deep learning-driven methods in medical image process-\ning have proven to be extremely useful in standardizing can-\ncer diagnosis as well as in improving patient stratification\n[19, 31]. Recently, a pioneering survey reported that deep\nlearning-based models can detect and categorize lung can-\ncer cases with accuracy similar to that of pathologists [20].\nPrevious studies suggest that deep learning is highly effi-\ncient in developing markers, which utilize basic morphology\nfor the prediction of outcomes in cancer patients [32, 33].\nA deep learning-based model developed by Coudray et al.\ncould even predict six of the most frequent genetic altera-\ntions directly from the slides [20]. In cases of gastrointestinal\ncancer, a deep learning-based model could directly estimate\nmicrosatellite instability based on just histological images\n[27]. Kather et al. also reported that a CNN could extract the\ntumor components and predict patient survival directly from\nhistology images [21]. Saillard et al. predicted the survival\nof HCC patients by extracting features from images using\na pre-trained CNN, following which the network selected\n25 tiles having maximum and minimum scores to predict\nsurvival [22]. In our study, a different method was used to\ndevelop the MobileNetV2_HCC_class to improve the pre-\ndiction of prognosis in HCC patients treated by surgical\nresection and LT. The innovative features of our method\nwere: (1) random tiles were used for each patient, like Skrede\net al. [17], (2) the MobileNet V2 was trained using MIL,\nwhich allowed for training on tile collections labeled with\nthe associated whole-slide image, and (3) the use of nuclear\narchitectural information in building of the model, which\nproved to be efficient for cancer grading and prediction of\npatient outcomes [24]. Genetic instability was demonstrated\nthrough diversifying nuclear shape and texture, which had a\nmajor effect on metastasis and proliferation that might lead\nto cancer recurrence. The MobileNetV2_HCC_class proved\nto be a strong predictor of RFS in HCC patients treated with\nresection or LT and generalized in the TCGA set across dif-\nferent centers.\n"
