The liver transplantation (LT) set (= 144) contained patients with HCC that had been treated\nby LT. The train set and its nuclear architectural information extracted by U-net were used to train the MobileNet V2-based\nclassifier (MobileNetV2_HCC_class). The classifier was then independently tested on the LT set and externally validated\non the TCGA set (n= 302). The primary outcome was recurrence free survival (RFS).\n"

The classifier provided\na hazard ratio of 3.44 (95% CI 2.01-5.87, p <0.001) for high risk versus low risk in the LT set, and 2.55 (95% CI 1.64—-3.99,\np <0.001) when known prognostic factors, remarkable in univariable analyses on the same cohort, were adjusted. The Mobile-\nNetV2_HCC_class maintained a relatively higher discriminatory power [time-dependent accuracy and area under curve\n(AUC)] than other factors after LT or resection in the independent validation set (LT and TCGA set). Net reclassification\nimprovement (NRI) analysis indicated MobileNetV2_HCC_class exhibited better net benefits for the Stage_AJCC beyond\nother independent factors. A pathological review demonstrated that tumoral areas with the highest recurrence predictability\nfeatured the following features: the presence of stroma, a high degree of cytological atypia, nuclear hyperchromasia, and a\nlack of immune cell infiltration.\n"

                    "text": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the seventh most\ncommon malignant tumor and the third primary cause of\nmortality worldwide [1, 2]. The prevalence of HCC is rela-\ntively high in the Asia—Pacific countries [3]. Hepatectomy\nand liver transplantation (LT) are still the main treatment\napproaches of HCC. Despite significant progress in diag-\nnostic and management techniques for HCC, the recur-\nrence rate is still high (up to 70-80%) following hepatec-\ntomy and 20-40% following LT [4-6]. A refinement of\nprognostic models, especially those based on the acces-\nsible data, could easily allow for detection of early warn-\ning signs during follow-up and prolonging adjuvant thera-\npeutic decisions [7]. The establishment of precise HCC\nrecurrence model for HCC patients after operation is dif-\nficult. Several clinical risk factors, using conventional Cox\nproportional hazards regression, have been identified to\npredict HCC recurrence, including maximum tumor diam-\neter, tumor number, tumor differentiation, macrovascular\ninvasion, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level [8-11].\nMetroticket 2.0 Model was developed based on level of\nAFP, tumor size, and tumor number, to determine risk of\ndeath from HCC-related factors after liver transplantation\nusing a competing-risk Cox_PH regression analysis [12].\nIn addition, the biomarkers such as genes, proteins, and\nmiRNAs are investigated and integrated into the diagnosis\nand prognosis model [13-15]. miRNAs with the advantage\nof reliability are good choice for biomarkers. The biomark-\ners were proved to have a better survival prediction power\nthan tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage (miRNA-AUC\ntest =0.64 vs. TNM-AUC test = 0.61) [16]. However, the\nbiomarkers suffer from economic and time costs. The\nwidely available pathology slides contain morphological\nmarkers of disease progression [17, 18], which is not rou-\ntinely used to objectively extract prognostic biomarkers.\n"

Recently, a pioneering survey reported that deep\nlearning-based models can detect and categorize lung can-\ncer cases with accuracy similar to that of pathologists [20].\nPrevious studies suggest that deep learning is highly effi-\ncient in developing markers, which utilize basic morphology\nfor the prediction of outcomes in cancer patients [32, 33].\nA deep learning-based model developed by Coudray et al.\ncould even predict six of the most frequent genetic altera-\ntions directly from the slides [20]. In cases of gastrointestinal\ncancer, a deep learning-based model could directly estimate\nmicrosatellite instability based on just histological images\n[27]. Kather et al. also reported that a CNN could extract the\ntumor components and predict patient survival directly from\nhistology images [21]. Saillard et al. predicted the survival\nof HCC patients by extracting features from images using\na pre-trained CNN, following which the network selected\n25 tiles having maximum and minimum scores to predict\nsurvival [22]. In our study, a different method was used to\ndevelop the MobileNetV2_HCC_class to improve the pre-\ndiction of prognosis in HCC patients treated by surgical\nresection and LT. The innovative features of our method\nwere: (1) random tiles were used for each patient, like Skrede\net al. [17], (2) the MobileNet V2 was trained using MIL,\nwhich allowed for training on tile collections labeled with\nthe associated whole-slide image, and (3) the use of nuclear\narchitectural information in building of the model, which\nproved to be efficient for cancer grading and prediction of\npatient outcomes [24]. Genetic instability was demonstrated\nthrough diversifying nuclear shape and texture, which had a\nmajor effect on metastasis and proliferation that might lead\nto cancer recurrence. The MobileNetV2_HCC_class proved\nto be a strong predictor of RFS in HCC patients treated with\nresection or LT and generalized in the TCGA set across dif-\nferent centers.\n"

With the well-developed prediction models, they\nwould likely become more widely applied to support clini-\ncal decision-making, and can benefit patients by stratifying\nrisks and guiding treatment options, as well as by avoiding\nineffective or unnecessary treatments. Additionally, the pro-\ncessing and computing time in this approach is brief enough\nto avoid delay in therapy. Therefore, this method facilitates\nthe easy application of the risk stratification system clini-\ncally. However, this study is limited by the lack of interpret-\nability. CNNs are generally seen as “black boxes” [36]. This\nis particularly true for image analysis, and the limitation of\nthis phenomenon is an active area of research. Data are pro-\ncessed through complex layers of CNNs, and it is difficult to\nidentify the most relevant features used by trained models\nfor final classification. We extracted the most pertinent tiles\nand did the subsequent analysis. We show that the classifi-\ncation obtained is at least partly based on known pathologi-\ncal features associated with the prognosis of tumor, such as\nthe presence of stroma, a high degree of cytological atypia,\nnuclear hyperchromasia, and a lack of immune cell infiltra-\ntion [37]. However, these features are just what pathologists\nknow strongly linked to a high risk of poor survival. We\nthus believe that some other important features which can-\nnot be recognized or microstructural features that cannot be\nconsistently identified by the naked eye, but these features\nwhich could potentially be reflective of tile classification\nmay be ignored. The so-called high risk or low risk are the\noverall output result of tiles via considering all risk features\non tiles learned by CNNs. That maybe can explain why low-\nrisk tiles contain some high-risk features, although the ratio\nis small. The proposed deep learning model detects not all\nbut the majority of established histological patterns related\nto recurrence in HCC patients.\n"
