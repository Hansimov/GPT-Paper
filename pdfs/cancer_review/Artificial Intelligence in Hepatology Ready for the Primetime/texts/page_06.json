            "text": "While ultrasound is the primary modality used for treat-\ning the NAFLD, due to unavailability of the skilled sonogra-\nphers, especially in resource-scarce regions, the quality of\ndiagnosis is severely affected. To address this problem, DL\nmethods for classifying the fatty liver in ultrasound images\nwere used. The performance analysis of the proposed frame-\nwork shows that the NAFLD in ultrasound images can be\ndetected with an accuracy of 90.6%.°* Liver biopsy is pres-\nently the gold standard modality for the diagnosis of\nNAELD. To remove the intra- and inter-observer variability,\na transfer-based DL algorithm, AlexNet-CNN was developed\nusing liver biopsy images in mice and compared to conven-\ntional non-DL algorithms - ANN, multi-nomial logistic re-\ngressions (MLR), support vector machine (SVM) and\nrandom forest (RF). It was shown that AlexNet-CNN could\nautomatically score liver fibrosis stages with a level of accu-\nracy similar to conventional non-DL algorithms.”° A super-\nvised DL model with a convolutional neural network (CNN)\narchitecture using high discrimination capability of histo-\nlogical tissue alterations of NAFLD showed a classification\naccuracy of 95%. The classification capability of the new\nCNN model showed superior classification accuracy\ncompared with a pre-trained AlexNet model, a visual geom-\netry group (VGG)-16 deep architecture and a conventional\nmulti-layer perceptron (MLP).°*\n"

            "text": "Diagnostic dilemma exists for some hepatic conditions\nlike drug-induced liver injury (DILI), primary sclerosing\ncholangitis (PSC), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) even af-\nter thorough clinical and biochemical examinations.\nDILI is a condition with serious consequences, especially\nwith the rampant use of complementary and alternative\nmedicines (CAM). DILI can present with various clinico-\npathologic presentations like acute hepatitis, chronic hep-\natitis, granulomatous hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis,\nsteatohepatitis, vascular disorders or tumours leading to\na lot of overlap in diagnosis. Hence AI tools*? with predic-\ntion models can help to predict the group of patients\nwhich can be predisposed to DILI and also can play an\nimportant role in diagnosis. Kristina et al°® demonstrated\na ML tool to detect PSC compatible cholangiographic im-\naging using 3D-MRCP images with high sensitivity. Eaton\net al’ gave a PSC Risk estimate tool (PREsTo) using 9\nbiochemical variables to predict the outcome in patients\nwith PSC, after excluding those with advanced PSC and\ncholangiocarcinoma. This ML tool using ‘Gradient Boosting’\ncan be an excellent non-invasive method for prediction of\ndecompensation, when compared to MELD score and\nMayo Risk Score. Similarly, a risk score for PBC*® was devel-\noped using ML. This unsupervised ML tool identified\nnovel subgroups of PBC patients and provided prognosis\nbased on serum albumin levels.
