Before it is used in clinical\npractice, AI requires rigorous studies, clinical validation in\na real-world scenario and publication in peer-reviewed jour-\nnals. There are concerns that machines in the future will\nreplace doctors, but the fact is that the designers of AI mod-\nules are cautious for that to happen. Human life is too\nprecious and cannot be experimented with as a ‘self-driven\ncar’. Hence the usage of AI in clinical practice will be slow\nand cautious, first involving processes with minimal risk\nand complications. Gradually this will lay the foundation\nfor high-performance medicine, which will absorb more\nand more human data, decreasing the reliance on human\nresources and eventually form a symbiotic relationship be-\ntween human and machine intelligence for the betterment\nof humankind. The expansion of AI in gastroenterology\nand hepatology is crucial for the progress of these fields.\nAlso, the use of Al is advantageous compared to traditional\nregression analysis methods used in research by incorpo-\nrating large samples and by reducing interobserver bias.\n"
