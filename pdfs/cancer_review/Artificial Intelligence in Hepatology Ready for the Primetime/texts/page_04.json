So, preoperative evaluation of the\ntumour-gene expression preferably though non-invasive\nroutes are the ideal target. With the genomic revolution\nin the early 1990s, medical research has been driven to\nstudy the basis of human disease on a genomic level and\ndevise precise cancer therapies tailored to a tumour's spe-\ncific genetic makeup. The novel approach of using radio-\nmics to extract genomic data has been termed\n“radiogenomics”. It aims to correlate the genotype (gene ex-\npressions and mutations) and phenotype (imaging charac-\nteristics), to facilitate a deeper understanding of tumour\nbiology and study the intrinsic tumour heterogeneity.\nImaging characteristics can then behave as molecular sur-\nrogates that can help to predict gene-expression-associated\ntreatment responses of various forms of cancer. These find-\nings pave a way for the futuristic role of diagnostic and in-\nterventional radiologists in using radiographic images for\nthe genetic assessment of cancer patients. '*\n"

Some of the studies done using AI algo-\nrithms will be mentioned in the following sections. Wang\nD. et al'° proposed a bayesian learning algorithm to develop\na three-layer artificial neural network (ANN) in patients\nwith CHB.
