AI tools\nsuch as machine learning, deep learning, and ‘big data’ are in a continuous phase of evolution, presently being\napplied for clinical and basic research. In this review, we have summarized various AI applications in hepatology,\nthe pitfalls and AI's future implications. Different AI models and algorithms are under study using clinical, lab-\noratory, endoscopic and imaging parameters to diagnose and manage liver diseases and mass lesions. AI has\nhelped to reduce human errors and improve treatment protocols. Further research and validation are required\nfor future use of AI in hepatology. (J Ciin Exp HepaTor 2023;13:149-161)\n"

The synergy\nof Al and precision medicine has augmented the yield of highly\npersonalized medical diagnostic and therapeutic informa-\ntion. The ultimate goal of this combination is the preven-\ntion and early detection of diseases affecting the\nindividual, which could ultimately decrease the disease\nburden for the public at large, and, therefore, the cost of pre-\nventable health care for all. Genotype-guided treatment of\nHCC is an example of precision medicine. The genetic charac-\nterization of HCC is not well established like other malig-\nnancies due to a lack of genomic studies. However, ‘big\ngenomic data’ and AI analysis will help identify patients\nwith CLD who are at high risk for fibrosis or HCC. Patients\nwith advanced HCC are presently treated with newer agents\nsuch as molecular targeted therapy or immunotherapy.\nHowever, the group of patients who will respond to the\ndrugs is not known. If AI can predict this treatment\nresponse, precision medicine can become a reality soon.\n"

Appli-\ncations of AI have expanded in all branches of medicines,\nespecially endoscopy and hepatology. The conglomeration\nof data which can be clinical/laboratory, multi-omics, natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) and Image recognition (both\nradiology-based and pathology-based) has contributed to the\nprediction of fibrosis, classification of liver masses and pre-\ndiction of treatment response and transplant outcomes. ’®\nIn this review the majority of studies mentioned focussed\non diagnosis part. There are very few studies that help to\npredict treatment response, post-liver transplant response,\nand prediction of hepatotoxicity in newer drug develop-\nment and more studies are needed. AI also helps for real-\ntime biomonitoring, by identification of patients at high\nrisk of clinical decompensation and hospital admission,\nso that timely intervention can be done for high-risk pa-\ntients. With the increasing advancement of image capture\nand storage, AI will bring striking changes to the diagnosis\nof various liver diseases with the ‘big data’ being available.\nHowever, there are many hurdles to overcome, which re-\nsearchers will do in the near future using validation studies\nand molecular research. It is expected that gastroenter-\nology and hepatology will be one of the first areas in med-\nicine to introduce AI tools on a wide-scale basis, due to its\ninherent reliance on endoscopic and radiological imaging.\nHence, GI and liver specialists should be proud that our\nfield sets the ground for AI development in medicine.\n"
