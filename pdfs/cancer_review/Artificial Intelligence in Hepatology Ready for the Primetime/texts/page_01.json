AI in hepatology has shown tremendous promise to plan appropriate management and\nhence improve treatment outcomes. The field of AI is in a very early phase with limited clinical use. AI tools\nsuch as machine learning, deep learning, and ‘big data’ are in a continuous phase of evolution, presently being\napplied for clinical and basic research. In this review, we have summarized various AI applications in hepatology,\nthe pitfalls and AI's future implications. Different AI models and algorithms are under study using clinical, lab-\noratory, endoscopic and imaging parameters to diagnose and manage liver diseases and mass lesions. AI has\nhelped to reduce human errors and improve treatment protocols. Further research and validation are required\nfor future use of AI in hepatology. (J Ciin Exp HepaTor 2023;13:149-161)\n"
