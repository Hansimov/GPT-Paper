Similarly, using the non-invasive\nfibrosis-4 score (FIB-4 score), in the discovery dataset (n =\n490) of CHB patients, a learning algorithm known as\nGradient Boosting (GB) clearly proved the superiority of\nother methods as well as FIB-4 score (P < 0.001) in the pre-\ndiction of advanced hepatic failure and cirrhosis.'° DL and\nradiomics can be used for quantitative analyses of liver\nfibrosis'’ in CHB cirrhosis. To improve the staging of\nfibrosis, machine learning (ML)-based classification of\nreal-time tissue elastography (RTE) was developed based\non four classical classifiers (i.e. Support vector machine, Naove\nBayes, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbour).'® Wang K.\net al'° by a prospective multi-centre study, have shown\nthat radiomics of shear wave elastography (DLRE) per-\nformed better for liver fibrosis prediction in patients with\nCHB when compared to two-dimensional shear wave elas-\ntography (2D-SWE) or serum markers.

Various AI modules\nhave been framed to study cirrhosis due to CHC, some of\nwhich are being mentioned. Using 414 liver biopsies\nfrom transplant explants (training dataset) and testing\non the remaining 96 biopsies (validation set), with a cut-\noff of >0.4, ANN given by Piscaglia et al*' provided an accu-\nrate prediction of significant fibrosis based on clinical vari-\nables, hence avoiding unnecessary liver biopsies,\nparticularly in the setting of liver transplantation. In\nanother study by Hasheem et al,”, using ML algorithm\non 39,567 patients with CHC, four parameters - age,\nAST, platelet count and albumin were found to be statisti-\ncally significant for advanced fibrosis. Konerman et al?\ndemonstrated AI models, constructed using two ML\nmethods (Boosting and Random Forest) and logistic regression\nin CHC patients, which helped to target costly therapies\nin patients who needed it urgently. Analysis of 72,638 pa-\ntients with CHC of the National Veterans Health Adminis-\ntration data showed that boosted survival tree-based models\nusing longitudinal information were statistically better\nthan cross-sectional or linear models for cirrhosis predic-\ntion in CHC.”* An ANN was created by Takayama et al\nthat identified patients with CHC who responded to ther-\napy with pegylated interferon a-2b plus ribavirin with 82%\nsensitivity and 88% specificity, in the era before the use of\ndirectly acting antivirals (DAA) for CHC.\n"
