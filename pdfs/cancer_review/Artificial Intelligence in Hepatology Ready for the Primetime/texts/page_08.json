These 3D models com-\nbined with hydrodynamic analysis have been used to diag-\nnose and manage portal hypertension.°” An ANN was used\nto predict survival times of 1168 patients planned for liver\ntransplantation, by Khosravi et al.°* It estimated a survival\nprobability of 1-5 years with an AUROC curve of 86.4% vs.\n80.7% for Cox proportional hazard regression models.\nANN has helped to make liver donor-recipient matching\nmodels by researchers, providing powerful technology\nthat would ease decision-making.” AI tools using liver seg-\nmentation will hence help to plan hepatic resection, pre-\nvent donor-recipient mismatch, improve survival of graft\nand patient overall and also help in the approval of new\nimmunosuppressant drugs by playing an important role\nin research and development in drug trials.
