Despite decades of research and development of new treatment\noptions, the overall outcomes of patients with HCC continue to remain poor.\nThere are areas of unmet need in risk prediction, early diagnosis, accurate pro-\ngnostication, and individualized treatments for patients with HCC. Recent years\nhave seen an explosive growth in the application of artificial intelligence (AI)\ntechnology in medical research, with the field of HCC being no exception. Among\nthe various AI-based machine learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms are\nconsidered state-of-the-art techniques for handling and processing complex\nmultimodal data ranging from routine clinical variables to high-resolution\nmedical images. This article will provide a comprehensive review of the recently\npublished studies that have applied deep learning for risk prediction, diagnosis,\nprognostication, and treatment planning for patients with HCC.\n"
