            "text": "A currently under-explored, but highly promising and exciting area for the\napplication of DL is the field of autonomous robotics. In a recent editorial, Gumbs et al\n[64] state that while the current form of robotic surgery seems like a form of minimally\ninvasive surgery, the true power of robotic surgery exists in its potential to create\nautonomous actions. Recently, a DL-based surgical instrument tracking algorithm was\nable to closely track the instruments during robotic surgery and evaluate the surgeons’\nperformance, demonstrating that DL algorithms can learn the correct steps of robotic\nsurgery[65]. With the help of DL and other AI technologies, it may be possible to\nimagine a future where fully autonomous robots perform resection of large, complex\nHCC in ways that no human surgeons can mimic. However, there are significant\nbarriers before the idea of fully autonomous robotic surgery can become a reality,\nincluding the current technical limitations of autonomous surgical robotics, as well as\nthe hesitation of patients and providers to fully trust autonomous robots to perform\ninvasive operations. “Explainability” of the DL algorithms will be critical here, as\nhumans would need to be able to understand and correct every single mistake that an\nautonomous robot makes during surgery. Therefore, for the foreseeable future, DL will\nmost likely remain as a helpful, adjunctive tool to assist human surgeons.\n"
