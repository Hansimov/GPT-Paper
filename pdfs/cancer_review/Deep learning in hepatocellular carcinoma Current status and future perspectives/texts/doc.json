While the burden of HCC has been\ndeclining with effective antiviral therapy against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis\nC virus (HCV), HCC incidence related to metabolic syndrome will likely continue to\nrise due to the dramatic increase in the prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease\n(NAFLD) in the general population[3]. Decades of HCC research led to the deve-\nlopment of a screening protocol, non-invasive diagnostic modalities based on imaging,\nand various treatment modalities including surgical, locoregional and systemic\ntherapies[4,5]. However, the overall outcomes of patients with HCC continue to\nremain poor and there are areas of significant unmet need in risk prediction, early\ndetection, accurate prognostication, and individualized treatments for patients with\nHCc.\n"

While promising for\nresearchers, ensuring that such high volumes of data are turned into actionable\nknowledge can be a significant challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI) is thought to be\ncapable of synthesizing and analyzing multimodal data with superhuman degrees of\naccuracy or reliability, and recent years have seen a rapid growth in the application of\nAI to many fields of medicine including hepatology[6]. This “AI revolution” over the\npast decade has been possible due to the advent of deep learning technology. Deep\nlearning algorithms can process a broad spectrum of medical data from structured\nnumeric data such as vital signs and laboratory values, high dimensional data from\nmulti-omics studies, as well as digitized high-resolution images from various\nradiologic and histopathologic studies. This review aims to provide an overview as\nwell as highlight examples of the many potential applications of deep learning to\nimprove the care of patients with HCC.\n"

Recent advances in multi-omics related\nto HCC are expected to address this unmet need for novel biomarkers. Multi-omics\nrefers to an approach to biological analysis which utilizes data sets from multiple\n\"omics\", such as the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome and\nmicrobiome. Multi-omics experiments generate an enormous amount of information,\nand various machine learning techniques including DL that can help with the\ncomputational challenges of processing and analyzing such high dimensional data. Xie\net al[20] used gene expression profiling of peripheral blood to build an ANN model\nthat classifies HCC patients from a control group. Using a nine-gene expression\nsystem, the ANN was able to distinguish HCC patients from controls with an AUC of\n0.943, 98% sensitivity, and 85% specificity, although it should be noted that the control\ngroup was healthy individuals rather than patients with cirrhosis, which could have\noverestimated the performance of the model. Choi et al[21] proposed a novel network-\nbased DL method to identify prognostic gene signatures via G2Vec, a modified\nWord2Vec model originally used for natural language processing (NLP). When\napplied to gene expression data for HCC from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),\nG2Vec showed superior prediction accuracy for patient outcomes compared to\nexisting gene selection methods and was able to identify two distinct gene modules\nsignificantly associated with HCC prognosis. Chaudhary et al[22] used RNA\nsexquencing, miRNA, and methylation data of 360 HCC patients from TCGA to build\nan autoencoder, which is an unsupervised feed-forward neural network. Using this\nDL model, they were able to distinguish patients with survival differences and identify\nspecific mutations and pathways as predictors of aggressive tumor behavior.\n"

Due to their complexity, DL\nmodels are traditionally considered to be “black-box” models, meaning humans\ncannot understand how the DL models make their predictions. Interpretability of the\nDL models are crucial for physicians to accept and trust them in everyday clinical\npractice, and for troubleshooting and improving the models for rare cases. This is\nbeing addressed by recent developments in various “explainable AI” techniques but\ncurrently there is no clear consensus on the best methodology. Another potential\nlimitation is the generalizability of the individual DL algorithms. Concerns have been\nraised that AI algorithms developed at highly specialized academic medical centers\nusing their own patients’ data may over-represent certain groups of patients and not\naccurately reflect the real-world population of patients seen at local community\nhospitals. Finally, AI models, like other prediction models, are often not publicly\navailable, limiting external validation. Independent validation of the proposed model\nand comparison to old models are as important as deriving new models. Large-scale,\n"

In a recent editorial, Gumbs et al\n[64] state that while the current form of robotic surgery seems like a form of minimally\ninvasive surgery, the true power of robotic surgery exists in its potential to create\nautonomous actions. Recently, a DL-based surgical instrument tracking algorithm was\nable to closely track the instruments during robotic surgery and evaluate the surgeons’\nperformance, demonstrating that DL algorithms can learn the correct steps of robotic\nsurgery[65]. With the help of DL and other AI technologies, it may be possible to\nimagine a future where fully autonomous robots perform resection of large, complex\nHCC in ways that no human surgeons can mimic. However, there are significant\nbarriers before the idea of fully autonomous robotic surgery can become a reality,\nincluding the current technical limitations of autonomous surgical robotics, as well as\nthe hesitation of patients and providers to fully trust autonomous robots to perform\ninvasive operations. “Explainability” of the DL algorithms will be critical here, as\nhumans would need to be able to understand and correct every single mistake that an\nautonomous robot makes during surgery. Therefore, for the foreseeable future, DL will\nmost likely remain as a helpful, adjunctive tool to assist human surgeons.\n"
