While the burden of HCC has been\ndeclining with effective antiviral therapy against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis\nC virus (HCV), HCC incidence related to metabolic syndrome will likely continue to\nrise due to the dramatic increase in the prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease\n(NAFLD) in the general population[3]. Decades of HCC research led to the deve-\nlopment of a screening protocol, non-invasive diagnostic modalities based on imaging,\nand various treatment modalities including surgical, locoregional and systemic\ntherapies[4,5]. However, the overall outcomes of patients with HCC continue to\nremain poor and there are areas of significant unmet need in risk prediction, early\ndetection, accurate prognostication, and individualized treatments for patients with\nHCc.\n"

While promising for\nresearchers, ensuring that such high volumes of data are turned into actionable\nknowledge can be a significant challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI) is thought to be\ncapable of synthesizing and analyzing multimodal data with superhuman degrees of\naccuracy or reliability, and recent years have seen a rapid growth in the application of\nAI to many fields of medicine including hepatology[6]. This “AI revolution” over the\npast decade has been possible due to the advent of deep learning technology. Deep\nlearning algorithms can process a broad spectrum of medical data from structured\nnumeric data such as vital signs and laboratory values, high dimensional data from\nmulti-omics studies, as well as digitized high-resolution images from various\nradiologic and histopathologic studies.
