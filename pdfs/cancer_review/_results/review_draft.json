                "### Topic: A detailed analysis of the existing challenges and limitations in the use of AI for liver cancer management.\n\n### Refinement:\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) based on machine learning and deep learning has been widely used in liver cancer research. Early studies focused on simple data analysis, such as genes and molecules. However, with the standardization of imaging diagnosis, AI research based on imaging has emerged. Deep learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has promoted progress in this field. Current challenges include overfitting of data, limited explainability, and poor generalizability of AI models. Additionally, there is a lack of quantitative analysis and reviews that explore the latest research trends. Future research should focus on the fusion analysis of multiple data types, precision treatment methods, and multi-modal treatment decision-making in liver cancer.\n\n### References:\n\n[1] Quantitative analysis of artificial intelligence on liver cancer.
