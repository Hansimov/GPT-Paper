In this large study involving 380 HCC\npatients and 495 WSIs, a deep learning algorithm managed\nto establish and validate the DPS with high accuracy, supe-\nrior to most traditional LT criteria and classic recurrence\nprediction models. The neural network originally evaluated\nthe prognostic significance of each histological structure and\nhighlighted the dominant position of the immune cells. The\nindividual recurrence risk could be automatically calculated\nvia digital identification of each WSI, which greatly facili-\ntated the pathological diagnosis and recurrence evaluation\nof the LT patients. The C-indices of DPS reached 0.827 and\n0.794 in the two cohorts and further stratified patients within\nor beyond the Milan criteria and UCSF criteria (Fig. S3),\nwhich provided a deeper perspective for clinical practice.\nIn addition, our new risk score exhibited great compatibil-\nity with the clinical features in predicting post-LT recur-\nrence (Fig. $4). In view of the effectiveness and simplicity,\ndeeper statistical analysis was not performed on the com-\nbined model.\n"

This procedure bypassed\nthe need for the manual recognition of numerous postprocess\ntiles [37]. Multivariate Cox regression analysis has revealed\nthat immune cells were the most important histological\nstructure, followed by the portal area and hemorrhagic and\nnecrotic tissue. This result was consistent with the visuali-\nzation of the attention machine, in which areas outlined in\nred more involved immune cells (Fig. 2f). Since compre-\nhensive therapies including liver resection, transcatheter\narterial chemoembolization (TACE) and immunotherapies\nwere given before LT [38, 39], an activated tumor immune\nmicroenvironment was common in the study population.
