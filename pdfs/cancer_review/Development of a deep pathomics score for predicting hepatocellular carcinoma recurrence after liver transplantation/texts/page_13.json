The cluster results\nreflected a closer correlation between CD8*T cells and\nPD-L1, CTLA4 and TIM-3 in the early-recurrence subgroup\nthan in the none-recurrence subgroup (Fig. S8), suggest-\ning impaired antitumor cytotoxicity caused by immunosup-\npressive molecules. Except for IDO, all immunosuppressive\nmolecules were highly expressed in the early-recurrence\nsubgroup. The role of IDO in human LT remains unknown,\nwhile controversial conclusions have been drawn about its\nprognostic value after liver resection [45, 46]. Since the\nimmune balance between antitumor cytotoxicity and post-\nLT rejection is a complicated process regulated by effector\nimmune cells and immunosuppressive molecules, the prog-\nnostic role of immunosuppressive molecules is by no means\nconclusive in LT cases.\n"

DPS was superior to most clinical mod-\nels in guiding HCC surveillance strategies by accurately\npredicting post-LT recurrence and survival. DPS facilitated\nthe histological diagnosis of HCC-specific structures and\nhighlighted the prognostic significance of immune cells in\nthe TME of LT patients. Patients with low recurrence risk\nwere characterized by a state of immune activation. Future\nstudies should focus on the correlation between pathological\nsignatures and multiomics data.\n"
