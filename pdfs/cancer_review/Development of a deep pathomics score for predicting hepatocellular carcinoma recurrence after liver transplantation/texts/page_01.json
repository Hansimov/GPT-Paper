The C-indices of DPS achieved\n0.827 and 0.794 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Multivariate analysis for recurrence-free survival (RFS)\nshowed that DPS (HR 4.795, 95% CI 3.017—7.619) was an independent risk factor. Patients in the high-risk subgroup had a\nshorter RFS, larger tumor diameter and a lower proportion of clear tumor borders. At the cellular level, a higher infiltration\nof intratumoral NK cells was negatively correlated with recurrence risk.\n"
