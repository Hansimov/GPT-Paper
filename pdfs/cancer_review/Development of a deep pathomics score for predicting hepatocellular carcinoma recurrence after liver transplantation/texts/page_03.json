Clinical reports, H&E\nstaining and three panels of multicomplex immunofluorescent images\nwere analyzed. b After patch extraction, the classification network\nwas developed based on 60 annotated WSIs via supervised learning.\nSix tissue categories of HCC were identified with robust accuracy.\nThe remaining WSIs were analyzed by the network and segmentation\nmaps were generated. Next, we input the tiles of each tissue into the\nprognostic network with recurrence related data as labels. Modified\nDeepsurv network was applied to calculate the risk score for each\ntissue category. The prediction model consisted of convolutional lay-\ners and SE blocks. Two types of pooling operations were used before\nand after convolution operations. DPS was then constructed through\nweighted algorithm. Recurrence prediction, survival stratification and\nimmune infiltration were further explored.
