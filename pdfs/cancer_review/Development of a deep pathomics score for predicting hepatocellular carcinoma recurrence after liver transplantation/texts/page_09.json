Intratumoral NK cells were positively corre-\nlated with cDCs and CD8\"T cells in terms of cell density\n(Fig. 6e), potentially indicating increasing antigen presen-\ntation between NK cells and cDC in tumor microenviron-\nment (TME) of LT cases. Since the interaction between NK\ncells and CD8'T cells elicit specific cytolytic outcomes [31,\n32], the spatial proximity of these two cell types was fur-\nther explored by counting the closest distance between the\nnuclear center of the cells [33] (distances over 300 tm were\neliminated). The phenotype map and proximity distance are\nshown in Fig. 6f. Overall, an average closest distance of\n122.39 ym between NK cells and CD8*T cells was measured\n(Fig. 6g). Additionally, CD8*T cells were more proximal\nto NK cells in the non-recurrence subgroup than the early-\nrecurrence subgroup, with an average distance of 114.73 um\nand 155.39 ym, respectively (Fig. 6h, i). Furthermore, the\ndistribution pattern of distance tended to be discrete in the\nearly-recurrence subgroup. These results suggested that the\ninteraction between innate and adaptive immune systems\nestablished stronger cytotoxicity against tumor cells, leading\nto a stronger suppression of recurrence.\n"
