Multi-task deep learning network-based models\nwere constructed to predict future macrovascular invasion. The discrimination, calibration, and decision\ncurves were compared to identify the best model. We compared the time to macrovascular invasion and\noverall survival using the best model and related image heterogeneity scores (H-score). Then, we determined\nthe need for a segmentation subnet or the replacement deep learning algorithm by logistic regression in\nscreening clinical/radiological factors. Finally, an applet was constructed for future application.\n"

                    "text": "Generally, primary liver cancer ranks higher in mortality (second\nin men and fifth in women) than in incidence (fifth in men and ninth\nin women), making it a highly malignant cancer [1]. Pathologically,\n70—85% of primary liver cancers are hepatocellular carcinomas\n(HCCs).[1] For patients without extrahepatic metastasis or macrovas-\ncular invasion, liver resection and transarterial chemoembolization\n(TACE) are the guideline-recommended first-line treatments |2—3];\nhowever, because HCC is highly invasive and spreads easily into the\nvascular system, 5.4—38% of treated patients are found to have mac-\nrovascular invasion during follow-ups [4]. In contrast to microvascu-\nlar invasion (which only influences post-resection occurrence),\nmacrovascular invasion can lead to aggressive liver dysfunction and\npreclude patients from further treatments. Therefore, without proper\ntreatment, the median overall survival (OS) has been reported as\napproximately 2-7 to 4.0 months [2,4]. Several interventions such as\ntargeted, immune, and radiation therapies can prolong the median\nOS to over one year [4—6]. However, the safety and efficacy of such\ntreatments are highly dependent on early diagnosis and treatments\n{7—9]. With prediction of future macrovascular invasion, at least we\nmay have two methods to treat macrovascular invasion more effec-\ntively: the first is combining immunotherapy when macrovascular\ninvasion is radiologically occult [9]; the second is performing more\nfrequent follow-ups to detect it before it is too late. However, it is evi-\ndent that strategy may be more reasonable in high-risk population\nrather than in all the patients. Thus, identifying patients at high risks\nof macrovascular invasion is the first challenge to be solved before\nexploring such “early intervention” strategy. Therefore, determina-\ntion of timely interventions for macrovascular invasion has become a\ncritical clinical challenge in HCC.\n"

In a similar manner, prediction models may also help us to\nestablish a warning system for early intervention of macrovascular\ninvasion after liver resection, TACE, or ablation. Although many stud-\nies have focused on the prediction of microvascular invasion\n[11-12]. we still lack models for macrovascular invasion. The few\nrelated studies involve limitations such as combining patients with\nmicro- and macro-vascular invasions (only 18% patients had macro-\nvascular invasion) [13] in the study or only identifying factors regard-\ning existing rather than future macrovascular invasion [14].\nTherefore, further exploration is necessary to fill the gap between\nclinical needs and current studies.\n"

In addition to the BCLC stages,\nan invasive shape was designed to assess the ability of the tumor to\ninvade beyond the limitations of surrounding tissues, whereas anti-\ncorona enhancement was designed to assess the abnormal area of\nlow attenuation around the tumor. Both radiological characteristics\nreflected the influence of the surrounding area by the HCC, which\ncontained structures of the blood vessels. However, compared to\nModelbosistic-CR-DR’ the discrimination improvement of Model©®P®\nwas only significant in the training dataset. The calibration was obvi-\nous in both datasets.

Considering the complexity of HCC\nmanagement, although we prove that treatments and BCLC stages\nhave limited influence on the robustness of our model, the conclu-\nsions should be tested on a larger sample size in the future. With the\nenlargement of sample size, we may use extra validation datasets to\nfurther confirm the robustness of our model. We may also perform a\nmore detailed subgroup analysis, such as anatomical vs. non-anatom-\nical resection, drug-eluting bead vs conventional TACE, etc. Second,\nthis study was based on a Chinese population, where most of the HCC\ncases were caused by hepatitis B. Therefore, for western populations\n(where HCC is mainly caused by hepatitis C or alcoholic hepatitis),\nour model needs further validation. Third, to further improve the per-\nformance, the combination of other data resources such as MRI or\npathology may be explored. Fourth, owing to the \"black box\" effect,\nwhich is common in deep learning studies, we could not provide\npathological interpretation for the deep learning radiomics. Although\nour results have demonstrated the stability of our final model, further\nresearch may be required to explore its relationship with pathologi-\ncal changes in HCC.\n"
