            "text": "Generally, primary liver cancer ranks higher in mortality (second\nin men and fifth in women) than in incidence (fifth in men and ninth\nin women), making it a highly malignant cancer [1]. Pathologically,\n70—85% of primary liver cancers are hepatocellular carcinomas\n(HCCs).[1] For patients without extrahepatic metastasis or macrovas-\ncular invasion, liver resection and transarterial chemoembolization\n(TACE) are the guideline-recommended first-line treatments |2—3];\nhowever, because HCC is highly invasive and spreads easily into the\nvascular system, 5.4—38% of treated patients are found to have mac-\nrovascular invasion during follow-ups [4]. In contrast to microvascu-\nlar invasion (which only influences post-resection occurrence),\nmacrovascular invasion can lead to aggressive liver dysfunction and\npreclude patients from further treatments. Therefore, without proper\ntreatment, the median overall survival (OS) has been reported as\napproximately 2-7 to 4.0 months [2,4]. Several interventions such as\ntargeted, immune, and radiation therapies can prolong the median\nOS to over one year [4—6]. However, the safety and efficacy of such\ntreatments are highly dependent on early diagnosis and treatments\n{7—9]. With prediction of future macrovascular invasion, at least we\nmay have two methods to treat macrovascular invasion more effec-\ntively: the first is combining immunotherapy when macrovascular\ninvasion is radiologically occult [9]; the second is performing more\nfrequent follow-ups to detect it before it is too late. However, it is evi-\ndent that strategy may be more reasonable in high-risk population\nrather than in all the patients. Thus, identifying patients at high risks\nof macrovascular invasion is the first challenge to be solved before\nexploring such “early intervention” strategy. Therefore, determina-\ntion of timely interventions for macrovascular invasion has become a\ncritical clinical challenge in HCC.\n"

In a similar manner, prediction models may also help us to\nestablish a warning system for early intervention of macrovascular\ninvasion after liver resection, TACE, or ablation. Although many stud-\nies have focused on the prediction of microvascular invasion\n[11-12]. we still lack models for macrovascular invasion. The few\nrelated studies involve limitations such as combining patients with\nmicro- and macro-vascular invasions (only 18% patients had macro-\nvascular invasion) [13] in the study or only identifying factors regard-\ning existing rather than future macrovascular invasion [14].\nTherefore, further exploration is necessary to fill the gap between\nclinical needs and current studies.\n"
