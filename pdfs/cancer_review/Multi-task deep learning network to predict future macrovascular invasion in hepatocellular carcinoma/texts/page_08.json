To construct such a model with high accuracy, we assumed that\nbesides the traditional clinical factors, data from medical images\ncould be used to assess the heterogeneous information from the HCC\nlesions. Theoretically, although radiomics provides a massive amount\nof quantitative data, it may overlook the macro-changes across the\ntumor area, as well as differences adjacent to the outer boundary of\ntumor. Thus, we designed a set of radiological factors as a comple-\nmentary assessment, either for morphological differences (such as\nfusion lesions or non-intact HCC capsule) or for changes outside the\ntumor boundary (such as corona and anti-corona enhancement). The\nbetter performance of Model©®-® compared to Model?® and Model\nproved that clinical/radiological factors and radiomic features were\nindispensable in achieving high accuracy in predicting the risks of\nfuture macrovascular invasion.\n"
