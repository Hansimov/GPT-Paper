We\nused the results in the validation dataset to identify the best model.\nWhen the difference was limited, we then referred to the results of\ntraining dataset. Second, we tested whether the performance of the\nidentified best model was influenced by treatments or the BCLC stages.\nFinally, to identify the threshold for high-risk populations, we used the\nYorden index in the ROC curve to subgroup the patients and compared\nthe time to macrovascular invasion and OS, using Kaplan—Meier plots\nand the log-rank test. Moreover, to test whether the heterogeneity iden-\ntified by our MTnet was related to the outcomes, we grouped the\npatients using the image heterogeneity score within the tumor area\n(Supplementary Text S5, Supplementary Figure S1) and compared their\n"
