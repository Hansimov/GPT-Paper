Multi-task deep learning network-based models\nwere constructed to predict future macrovascular invasion. The discrimination, calibration, and decision\ncurves were compared to identify the best model. We compared the time to macrovascular invasion and\noverall survival using the best model and related image heterogeneity scores (H-score). Then, we determined\nthe need for a segmentation subnet or the replacement deep learning algorithm by logistic regression in\nscreening clinical/radiological factors. Finally, an applet was constructed for future application.\n"
