Third, a likelihood boosting approach was used to train Cox models from\nscratch, combining clinical/gene expression data with the histopathology features.\nTo compare predictive performance across models, we examined the distribution\nof concordance indices across folds, as well as the mean difference concordance\nwithin folds. Furthermore, we used a paired-Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare\nC estimates across models. To account for multiple comparisons, we used the\nHolm-Bonferroni correction as the FWER procedure.
