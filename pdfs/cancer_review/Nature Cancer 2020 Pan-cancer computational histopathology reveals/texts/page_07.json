All boxplots demarcate quartiles and median values, while whiskers extend to 1.5x the interquartile range. The number of patients for\neach cancer type is provided in the x axis labels. b, Kaplan-Meier plots with high (above median) and low (below median) PC-CHIiP risk, shown for cancer\nstages I-Ill in four different cancer types. ¢, Example tiles with high and low estimated risk based on the histopathological features. Each row corresponds\nto a cancer type.

A subset of\nboth cohorts contained pathologist-evaluated TIL categories, which\nconfirmed the predicted trends, and the algorithms ability to local-\nize TILs on a given slide was evident in both cohorts (Fig. 8d,f).\nPrognostic associations were replicated in both cohorts, although\nat reduced accuracy, particularly in METABRIC (Fig. 8e).
