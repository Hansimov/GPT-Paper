Each dot in the scatter plot corresponds to one of 12,000 tiles that were randomly selected across cancer types. The cell nucleus\nsize and intensity were calculated using Cell Profiler with a pipeline provided by the software provider. Boxplots depict the quartiles and median, whiskers\nextend to 1.5x the inter quartile range. b, AUC from PC-CHiP (y-axis) compared to hard coded features (x-axis) for a set of n=500 randomly selected\ntiles for each cancer type. Each dot represents a cancer type. Error bars correspond to 95% confidence intervals. Â¢, Histopathological prediction of WGD\nusing 5-fold cross validation (red) and models trained leaving out one cancer type (blue). Error bars correspond to 95% confidence intervals estimated by\nbootstrap resampling.\n"
