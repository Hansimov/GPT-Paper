Each point corresponds to the predicted AUC for the genomic alteration indicated at the bottom. Error bars correspond to 95%\nconfidence intervals. p-value estimated from Wilcox’s rank sum test and adjusted using FDR. b, The distribution of correlation between predicted and true\ntranscript level in METABRIC (x-axis) compared to those in TCGA (y-axis). Each dot represents a gene (n=14,756 genes); blue dots are the genes that can\nbe validated in METABRIC (Spearman’s rank correlation p > O, p-value estimated using two sided t-test, adjusted FDR<O.1).\n"
