This\napproach accurately classifies cancer types and provides spatially resolved tumor and normal tissue distinction. Automatically\nlearned computational histopathological features correlate with a large range of recurrent genetic aberrations across cancer\ntypes. This includes whole-genome duplications, which display universal features across cancer types, individual chromosomal\naneuploidies, focal amplifications and deletions, as well as driver gene mutations. There are widespread associations between\nbulk gene expression levels and histopathology, which reflect tumor composition and enable the localization of transcriptomi-\ncally defined tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Computational histopathology augments prognosis based on histopathological\nsubtyping and grading, and highlights prognostically relevant areas such as necrosis or lymphocytic aggregates. These findings\nshow the remarkable potential of computer vision in characterizing the molecular basis of tumor histopathology.\n"
