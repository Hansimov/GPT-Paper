We collected 17,355 hematoxylin and eosin-stained histopathology\n\nslides of 10,452 patients with 28 broadly defined cancer types from TCGA via the\nGenomic Data Commons Data Portal” (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/), including\nnormal, tumor and metastatic tissue types. Sample inclusion criteria defined by\nTCGA required primary untreated samples, frozen and sufficiently sized resection\nsamples and at least 60% tumor nuclei (https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/\norganization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga/studied-cancers). Scanned\nslides usually depict the top and bottom section of the tissue block used for\nmolecular analysis. Only tissue types with at least 50 images with a magnification\ngreater than 20x were included in this study. We first cropped the whole\n\nslides into tiles of 512 pixels x 512 pixels, with an overlap of 50 pixels, at\n\n20x magnification. We then removed blurred and non-informative tiles by filtering\non the weighted gradient magnitude (using Sobel operator, tiles with a weighted\ngradient magnitude smaller than 15 for more than half of the pixels were removed).\nTiles from tumor samples with a tumor purity >85% were used in training/\nvalidation to avoid mislabeled tiles in the training process. To avoid bias caused by\nimage preparation in individual laboratories, we randomly selected 80% of images\nfrom each center for training. In total, we used 6,502,594 tiles from 8,047 slides for\ntraining, 1,338,534 tiles from 1,682 slides for validation, and 6,547,172 tiles from\n7,628 slides for testing.\n"
