Each box plot shows the predicted TIL scores from PC-CHiP for tiles with different TIL raw counts,\nas independently evaluated by pathologists. b, Publically available slide-level TIL data displays lower concordance compared to with systematic blinded\nassessment of TIL (n=372 tiles). Each box plot shows the slide level TILs evaluation from TCGA for tiles with different TIL raw counts. Boxplots depict the\nquartiles and median, whiskers extend to 1.5x the inter quartile range.\n"
