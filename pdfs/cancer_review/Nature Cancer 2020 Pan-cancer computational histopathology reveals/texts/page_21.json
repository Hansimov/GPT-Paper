Error bars denote 95% confidence intervals. Sample sizes are n=149 tumor samples for BASIS; for\nMETABRIC, n=454 tumor samples were used for WGD status and copy number alterations; n=434 tumor samples were used for driver gene mutations.\nAdditional details can be found in Supplementary Table 4. b, Whole-slide average histopathology predictions for TILs from the modified network (x-axis)\nrelative to expert pathologist categories (y-axis). Boxplots depict the quartiles and median, whiskers extend to 1.5x the inter quartile range.
