Each boxplot corresponds to one cancer type, each box corresponds to the predicted tumor purity from histopathological features for\nsamples with the histopathologist evaluated tumor purity indicated on x-axis (total number of slides n=14,862). Boxplots depict the quartiles and median,\nwhiskers extend to 1.5x the inter quartile range.\n"
