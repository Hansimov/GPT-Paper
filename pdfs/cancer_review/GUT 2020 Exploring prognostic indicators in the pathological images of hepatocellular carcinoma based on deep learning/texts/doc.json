The postoperative surveil-\nlance, adjuvant treatments and post-recurrent management\nwere performed according to our uniform guidelines.'*? Tumour\ndifferentiation was determined by the Edmondson grading\nsystem, and liver cirrhosis was assessed by the Scheuer's system.\nTumours were staged according to the International Union\nAgainst Cancer Tumour-Node-Metastasis (TNM) Classification\n(eighth edition) and the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC)\nstaging system. Among these slides, 99 were excluded for poor\nsection quality and the remaining 2451 slides were captured\nand scanned for whole-slide images (WSIs). In addition to 260\nWSIs of 96 patients randomly selected for manual annotation,\nall the 2191 WSIs of 1029 patients were randomly divided into\na training set and a validation set (online supplementary table\n$1). Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time between\nsurgery and death, cancer-specific survival (CSS) was defined as\nthe time from surgery to death caused by HCC, and recurrence-\nfree survival (RFS) was defined as the time between surgery and\nrecurrence. Patients without recurrence or death were censored\nat the last follow-up. In the Zhongshan validation cohort, 184\npatients died, 75.5% of whom had tumour recurrence; among\nthe 344 living patients, 32.3% were diagnosed with tumour\nrecurrence. The median duration of follow-up was 56 months\n(range, 14~98 months). The 1-year, 3-year and 5-year overall\nsurvival rates were 89.7%, 74.1% and 68.2%, respectively, and\nthe 1-year, 3-year and 5-year recurrence rates were 23.0%,\n45.6% and 58.8%, respectively.

We found that the sinusoidal capil-\nlarisation, prominent nucleoli and karyotheca, high N/C ratio\nand immune response were powerful pathological features\naffecting survival. In addition to tumour cell intrinsic features,\nevidence has been accumulating that the composition, locali-\nsation and nature of immune cells in HCC could alter tumour\nbiological behaviour and affect disease progression.'* ** Indeed,\nwe observed an anti-tumour effect of these infiltrated immune\ncells, which may be T cells, such as CD4+ memory T cells or\neffector T cells, based on the TCGA data. Additionally, angio-\ngenesis gradually occurs by the microvascularisation of endo-\nthelial cells, which is associated with HCC invasiveness*’ and\nconsistent with our findings. Similarly, Saillard et al identified\nmacrotrabecular architectural pattern, vascular spaces, cyto-\nlogical atypia and nuclear hyperchomasia as high-risk features,\nwhile immune cell infiltration as low-risk feature.”” The consis-\ntency of the two studies perfectly illustrated that tissue struc-\nture, cellular morphology and immune response were the three\nessential features affecting patient prognosis. Presently, combina-\ntional antiangiogenics and immunotherapies represent the main\navenues in the treatment of advanced HCC;°* thus, TRS may be\nan important marker to predict and evaluate the effect of these\ncombination therapies.\n"
