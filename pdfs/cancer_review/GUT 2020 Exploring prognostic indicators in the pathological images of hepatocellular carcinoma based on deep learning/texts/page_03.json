The postoperative surveil-\nlance, adjuvant treatments and post-recurrent management\nwere performed according to our uniform guidelines.'*? Tumour\ndifferentiation was determined by the Edmondson grading\nsystem, and liver cirrhosis was assessed by the Scheuer's system.\nTumours were staged according to the International Union\nAgainst Cancer Tumour-Node-Metastasis (TNM) Classification\n(eighth edition) and the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC)\nstaging system. Among these slides, 99 were excluded for poor\nsection quality and the remaining 2451 slides were captured\nand scanned for whole-slide images (WSIs). In addition to 260\nWSIs of 96 patients randomly selected for manual annotation,\nall the 2191 WSIs of 1029 patients were randomly divided into\na training set and a validation set (online supplementary table\n$1). Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time between\nsurgery and death, cancer-specific survival (CSS) was defined as\nthe time from surgery to death caused by HCC, and recurrence-\nfree survival (RFS) was defined as the time between surgery and\nrecurrence. Patients without recurrence or death were censored\nat the last follow-up. In the Zhongshan validation cohort, 184\npatients died, 75.5% of whom had tumour recurrence; among\nthe 344 living patients, 32.3% were diagnosed with tumour\nrecurrence. The median duration of follow-up was 56 months\n(range, 14~98 months).
