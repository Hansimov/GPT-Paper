The phenotypic infor-\nmation present in pathological tissue reflects the overall effect\nof the tumour microenvironment on the behaviour of cancer\ncells. In addition to conventional pathological features such as\nmicrovascular invasion and tumour differentiation, novel prog-\nnostic histopathological features, including intratumour tertiary\nlymphoid structures,’ vessels encapsulating tumour clusters’ and\nthe macrotrabecular-massive subtype,° have been reported in HCC\nrecently. However, histopathological images that contain numerous\nphenotypic descriptions of the molecular processes underlying\nHCC initiation and progression remain largely unknown to\nsubjective judgement.’ Further in-depth analysis is needed to trans-\nlate the histopathological features of HCC into prognostic and\npredictive algorithms to improve patient stratification and clinical\nmanagement.\n"

A method that integrates the patient\nprognostication and visualisation of prognostic pathological\nphenotypes may facilitate oncologists to explore new patholog-\nical features. In this regard, network activations as saliency masks\nfor visualisations have become a popular method to explain deep\nlearning;'' '? however, their application in pathological images\nneeds further improvement. The existing methods can only visu-\nalise local coarse features rather than accurately decode cell-level\npathological features, such as nuclear atypia, mitotic activity,\ncellular density and tissue architecture. Additionally, a patho-\nlogical image contains enormous subtle and complex informa-\ntion, rendering pixel-level annotations a huge challenge. Weakly\nsupervised learning that only requires slide-level labels for\ntraining partially addresses the above considerations. However,\nthe existing weakly supervised learning usually requires tens of\nthousands of samples to converge, making it not widely used.\n"
