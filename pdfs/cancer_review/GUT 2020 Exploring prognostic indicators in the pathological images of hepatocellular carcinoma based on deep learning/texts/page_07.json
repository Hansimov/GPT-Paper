            "text": "By visualising and clustering the featured regions in heat-\nmaps, we detected four separated features at the 40 Xscale\n(figure 6A,B), and two features at the 10xscale and 4xscale\n(online supplementary figure S8A-C). Next, our pathologists\nreviewed and proposed the possible annotations on the featured\nregions. In the heatmaps at the 40 xscale, some sinusoidal areas\nwere labelled in red, and immunostaining revealed that these\nsinusoids were outlined by CD34+ cells (figure 6C), suggesting\nsinusoidal capillarisation in these areas. Likewise, prominent\nnucleoli and karyotheca cells and a high nucleus/cytoplasm\n(N/C) ratio were also displayed in red. Thus, the above three\nfeatures were probably associated with the increased risks of\nrecurrence and death. By contrast, the heatmaps specifically\nhighlighted the regions of inflammatory cells in blue, indicating a\nlow risk of recurrence and death. These inflammatory cells tend\nto be smaller and rounder with dark and homogeneous staining\ncompared with tumour cells. Additionally, sinusoidal capillari-\nsation and inflammatory cells were identified at the 10xscale\nand 4xscale. Importantly, most (>60%) sinusoidal capillarisa-\ntion, prominent nucleoli and karyotheca cells and high N/C ratio\ncells appeared in patients with high TRS, while most (>60%)\ninfiltrated inflammatory cells occurred in patients with low TRS\n(p<0.001) (figure 6D and online supplemental figure 8D). The\nC-index for the combination of the four features reached 0.724\n"
