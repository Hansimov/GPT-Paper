            "text": "It is challenging for doctors to extract new prognostic features\ndirectly from pathological images. Herein, we propose a quan-\ntitative and interpretable method to simplify this process.\nCombined with visualising and clustering of the fine-grained\nheatmaps, the doctors just need to define each potential feature\ndiscovered by our method. We found that the sinusoidal capil-\nlarisation, prominent nucleoli and karyotheca, high N/C ratio\nand immune response were powerful pathological features\naffecting survival. In addition to tumour cell intrinsic features,\nevidence has been accumulating that the composition, locali-\nsation and nature of immune cells in HCC could alter tumour\nbiological behaviour and affect disease progression.'* ** Indeed,\nwe observed an anti-tumour effect of these infiltrated immune\ncells, which may be T cells, such as CD4+ memory T cells or\neffector T cells, based on the TCGA data. Additionally, angio-\ngenesis gradually occurs by the microvascularisation of endo-\nthelial cells, which is associated with HCC invasiveness*’ and\nconsistent with our findings. Similarly, Saillard et al identified\nmacrotrabecular architectural pattern, vascular spaces, cyto-\nlogical atypia and nuclear hyperchomasia as high-risk features,\nwhile immune cell infiltration as low-risk feature.”” The consis-\ntency of the two studies perfectly illustrated that tissue struc-\nture, cellular morphology and immune response were the three\nessential features affecting patient prognosis. Presently, combina-\ntional antiangiogenics and immunotherapies represent the main\navenues in the treatment of advanced HCC;°* thus, TRS may be\nan important marker to predict and evaluate the effect of these\ncombination therapies.\n"
