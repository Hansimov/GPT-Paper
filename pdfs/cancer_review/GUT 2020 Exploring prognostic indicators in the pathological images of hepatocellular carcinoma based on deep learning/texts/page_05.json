We first compared the performance of\nthe global random sampling method (whole slide and irrespec-\ntive of tissue category) with that of the tissue category-based\nlocal sampling method, in which 32 tiles were sampled for\neach patient as input. As shown in figure 3A, we computed\nthe C-index via risk scores with different sampling methods\nunder different magnification scales. The performance of local\ntumour sampling was significantly higher than that of global\nrandom sampling at every magnification scale (p<0.0001).\nThe performance of the combination of the three magnifica-\ntion scales was always better than that of a single magnifi-\ncation scale (online supplementary figure S2A-C) because of\nthe capture of various features at different magnifications. The\nmedian C-index of risk scores from multi-scale tumour tissues\neven reached 0.731. This result demonstrated our hypothesis\nthat local tumour sampling as prior knowledge can significantly\nreduce the complexity of prognostic network optimisation.\n"
