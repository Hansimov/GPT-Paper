(A) Visualisation of the heatmaps of high-risk (sinusoidal capillarisation, high N/C ratio\nand prominent nucleoli and karyotheca) and low-risk features (inflammatory cells) related to TRS at the 40xscale. Pathologists reviewed and defined\neach feature. On the left of each panel is the original tile of WSls; on the right is the heatmap. The red area indicates potentially increased risk, and\nthe blue area indicates reduced risk. Red curve circled indicates sinusoidal capillarisation and blue arrows indicate inflammatory cells. (B) The four\npotential features extracted from heatmaps at the 40xscale were separated by the t-SNE algorithm. (C) Immunostaining revealed that the sinusoids\nin the tumour were outlined by CD34+ cells, suggesting sinusoidal capillarisation in these areas. (D) The distribution of each potential feature was\nquantified using a stacked histogram in patients grouped by TRS. The data were compared using multivariate analysis of variance. (E) C-index for each\npotential feature and the combination of these features. ***, p < 0.001. N/C,nucleus/cytoplasm; TRS, tumour risk score; WSls, whole-slide images.\n"
