(A) Gross, microscopic and immunohistochemical features associated with\nCTNNB1 mutations. (B) Gross appearance of aCTNNB1 mutated tumour: the tumour has\nan intact capsule and a green color due to,bile production. (C) Microscopic features of a\nCTNNB1 mutated HCC: microtrabecular and pseudoglandular architectural pattern with\nnumerous bile plugs within the, lumens of the pseudoglands (black arrows)\n(#CHC1715T). (D) Nuclear B-catenin staining (left panel, #CHC1715T) with strong GS\nexpression (right panel, #CHC1715T). (E) Gene expression profiling of CTNNB1 mutated\ntumours: maintenance of markers of hepatocellular differentiation and function, low cell\nproliferation, dysregulation in bile salts transporters expression with up-regulation of\ntransporters involved in canalicular bile salts efflux and down-regulation of transporters\nresponsible for bile salts efflux into blood flow, low IL6/JAK/STAT pathway activation\nand upregulation of Wnt/B-catenin pathway targets (CTNNB1 mutated cases n=35;\nCTNNB1 non-mutated cases, n=149). (F) Schematic representation of a CTNNB1 mutated\nneoplastic cell: the dysregulation of bile salts transporters (upregulation=red, down\nregulation= green) leads to bile salts uptake from the blood flow and excretion into the\ncanaliculi _(pseudogland lumen). HES=Hematein-Eosin-Saffron, Expres= expression,\nT=tumour, NT=non-tumour. Comparison between qualitative and quantitative data was\nperformed using Chi-square and Fisher exact tests and Mann-Whitney U and Kruskall-\nWallis tests, respectively. Monte-Carlo method was used to adjust the P value for\nmultiple tests.\n"
