Mixed etiologies were observed in 15% of the patients. Different\ndisease stages were included with very early/early (BCLC 0-A, 67%) as well_as\nintermediate /advanced (BCLC B-C, 33%) tumours. High AFP protein levels (>100ng/ml)\nwere detected in 28% of the patients. As expected in a series of surgically resected HCC,\nwe identified a high rate of non-cirrhotic patients (FO-F1 38%, F2-F3 33%, F4 29%).\nEarly relapse and disease-related death occurred in 41% (115/278) and 33% (92/278)\nof the patients, respectively.\n"
