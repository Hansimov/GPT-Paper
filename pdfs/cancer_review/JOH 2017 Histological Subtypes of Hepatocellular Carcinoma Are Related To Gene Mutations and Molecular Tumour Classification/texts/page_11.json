            "text": "Noticeably, TP53 mutations were also strongly correlated to the novel macrotrabecular-\nmassive subtype of HCC (MTM-HCC) identified during the pathological review (P<0.001)\n(Figure 2A and 3A-D). This subtype, representing 10% of all tumours and characterised\nby a predominant (>50%) macrotrabecular growth pattern, was more frequent in HBV\ninfected patients (P=0.007), with high AFP serum levels (P=0.02) and histological\nfeatures of aggressiveness (satellite nodules P<0.001, macrovascular P<0.001 and\nmicrovascular P<0.001 invasion) (Figure 3E and supplemental Table 4). Regarding\nmolecular alterations and gene expression, we observed an association of MTM-HCC\nwith G3 subgroup (P<0.001), TP53 (P<0.001) and ATM mutations (P=0.03), FGF19\namplifications (P=0.02), and angiogenesis activation (upregulation of ANGPT2 P=0.004\nand an almost significant trend towards VEGFA overexpression P=0.07) (Figure 3E and\nSupplemental Table 5). This subtype also frequently demonstrated a progenitor\nphenotype (CK19 immunohistochemical expression P=0.02) (Figure 3E). Finally, MTM-\nHCC was significantly associated, in multivariate analysis, with early tumour relapse\n(p=0.05) and poor overall survival (p=0.03) (Table 2 and Figure 3F). Moreover, it\nretained a prognostic value even when patients were stratified according to the\nexistence of microvascular invasion and satellite nodules (p<0.001).\n"

In this line, RT-PCR experiments\nrevealed up-regulation of progenitor/cancer stem cell genes (CD24, KRT19, THY1,\nCD133), and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition activation (TGFB, VIM) (Figure 4D and\nSupplemental Table 5). A trend of increased phospho-S6 protein expression was\nobserved (50% vs 31%, P=0.2).\n\n-The steatohepatitic subtype of HCC was not related to specific clinical features, but\ndisplayed a less aggressive histological phenotype with a lack of satellite nodules\n(P=0.02) and microvascular invasion (P=0.04)(Figure 4E and F, Supplemental Table 4).\nAt the molecular level, it was associated with the G4 transcriptomic subgroup and to a\nlack of Wnt/B-catenin pathway activation (lack of CTNNB1 mutations P=0.01 and low GS\nexpression P=0.005) (Figure 4F). Activation of the IL6/JAK/STAT pathway was frequent\n"
