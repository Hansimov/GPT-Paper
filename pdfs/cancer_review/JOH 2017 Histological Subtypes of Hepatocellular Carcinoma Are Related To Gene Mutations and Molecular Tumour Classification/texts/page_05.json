They are mainly\nrepresented by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that results from the malignant\ntransformation of hepatocytes. The most frequent risk factors of HCC comprise alcohol\nintake, infection by hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) viruses, and metabolic\nsyndrome [2]. Although surveillance protocols of patients at-risk to develop HCC have\nsignificantly improved, clinical outcome remains poor with a majority of patients\npresenting with advanced disease not eligible for curative therapy [3].\n"

            "text": "At the pathological level, HCC is a morphologically heterogeneous tumour [4,.5]. If HCC\nneoplastic cells most often grow in cords of variable thickness lined by endothelial cells\nmimicking the trabeculae and sinusoids of normal liver, other architectural pattern are\nfrequently observed and numerous cytological variants are also recognized, comprising\nclear, pleomorphic, or bile producing cells [4-6]. Moreover, several,HCC subtypes\ndefined by distinctive and easily recognizable histological features:/have been identified\n[4, 5, 7]. In the last decade, there has been a growing interest for a particular subtype of\nHCC with so-called “progenitor features”. Thought to derive from progenitor cells, this\ntumour subtype shares an overlapping gene expression profile with oval cells and fetal\nhepatoblasts [8]. It is characterized by an. adverse clinical outcome and\nimmunohistochemical expression of cytokeratin 19. (CK19) by more than 5% of\nneoplastic cells is usually considered as a surrogate marker of this variant [9].\n"
