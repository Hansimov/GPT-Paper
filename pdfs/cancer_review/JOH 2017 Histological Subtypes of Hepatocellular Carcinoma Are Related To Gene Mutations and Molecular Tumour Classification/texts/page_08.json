            "text": "For 129 cases, we extracted data from our former whole-exome sequencing study and\nselected genes mutated or altered in at least 5% of the tumours (TERT promoter,\nCTNNB1 exon 3, TP53, ALB, ARID1A, AXIN1, APOB, NEF2L2, ARID2, TSC1/TSC2, ATM,\nCDKN2A, ACVR2A, RPS6KA3, FGF19) [16]. For additional cases, genomic DNA was\nextracted using a Promega Maxwell® Instrument and samples were further sequenced\nfor TERT promoter, CTNNB1, TP53, AXIN1, ALB, APOB, ARID1A, ARID2, NFE2L2, ATM,\nTSC1/TSC2 and RPS6KA3, using a MiSeq instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA)\n(Supplemental Material and Methods), or direct Sanger sequencing, as previously\ndescribed [15]. It has been formerly demonstrated that HCC display a relatively modest\ndegree of intra-tumour heterogeneity regarding driver genetic alterations [27-29], and\none frozen sample was available and analyzed for each case.\n"

            "text": "Statistical analysis was performed using R software (3.2.2)..C€omparison between\nqualitative and quantitative data was performed using Chi-square,and Fisher exact tests\nand Mann-Whitney U and Kruskall-Wallis tests, respectively..Monte-Carlo method was\nused to adjust the P value for multiple tests. Patients»with curative (RO) resection\n(n=278) and features with more than 10% infrequency were included in survival\nanalysis. Variables associated with disease-specific»survival were identified using\nunivariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models (Wald test),\nusing the survival, rms and Publish packages. Prior tothe multivariate analysis, collinear\nvariables (BCLC B-C and macrovascular invasion; macrotrabecular histological pattern\nand macrotrabecular-massive subtype) were first tested in a bivariate analysis and the\nvariable with the highest OR was further included in the multivariate analysis. Kaplan-\nMeier plots were used to describe survival rates among all cases. All reported P values\nwere two-tailed and differences were considered significant when the P value was under\n0.05.\n"
