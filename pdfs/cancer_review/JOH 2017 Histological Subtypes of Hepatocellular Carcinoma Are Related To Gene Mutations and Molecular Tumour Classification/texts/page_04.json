            "text": "Results: CTNNB1 (40%) and TP53 (21%) mutations were mutually exclusive and\ndefined two major groups of HCC characterized by distinct phenotypes., CTNNB1\nmutated-tumours were large (P=0.002), well-differentiated (P<0.001), cholestastic\n(P<0.001), with microtrabecular (P<0.001) and pseudoglandular (P<0.001) patterns and\nwithout inflammatory infiltrates (P<0.001). TP53 mutated-tumours were poorly-\ndifferentiated (P<0.001) with compact pattern (P=0.02), multinucleated (P=0.01) and\npleomorphic (P=0.02) cells and frequent vascular invasion (P=0.02). World Health\nOrganization (WHO) histological subtypes were also strongly.related to molecular\nfeatures. The scirrhous subtype was associated with TSC1/TSC2 mutations (P=0.005),\nepithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and a _ progenitor..expression profile. The\nsteatohepatitic subtype showed frequent IL-6/JAK/STAT, activation without CTNNB1,\nTERT and TP53 pathway alterations (P=0.01). Pathological review identified a novel\nsubtype, designated as \"macrotrabecular-massive\". associated with poor survival\n(P<0.001), high alphafoeto-protein serum level (P=0.02), vascular invasion (P<0.001),\nTP53 mutations (P<0.001) and FGF19 amplifications (P=0.02), features also validated in\nTCGA data. Finally, integration of HCC pathological characteristics with its\ntranscriptomic classification showed phenotypically distinct tumour subclasses closely\nrelated to G1-G6 subgroups.\n"
