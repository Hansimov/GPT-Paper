One digital slide was available for each case, and, after the exclusion of cases with\nhistological features suggestive of either cholangiocarcinoma (n=8) or\nhepatocholangiocarcinoma (n=3), a series of 359 HCC with molecular data was finally\nselected for further analysis (\"TCGA Cohort\"). For survival and early relapse studies,\npatients with a prior history of anti-tumour treatment and/or incomplete surgical\nresection (R1 or R2) were excluded. Survival and relapse status were available in 313\nand 277 cases, respectively.\n"
