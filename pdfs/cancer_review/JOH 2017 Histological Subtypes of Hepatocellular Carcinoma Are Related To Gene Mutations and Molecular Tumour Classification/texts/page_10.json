            "text": "CTNNB1 mutations define a specific cholestatic well-differentiated subtype of HCC.\nWe further searched for correlations between gene mutations/alterations and\npathological features. Interestingly, the major correlations were identified with CTNNB1\nexon 3 and TP53 mutations, which showed, as formerly reported, a significant tendency\ntowards mutual exclusivity (P<0.001) (Supplemental Table 3).[30] CTNNB1 mutated\ntumours represented 40% of the series and were more frequently large (Odds ratio (OR)\n2.14, P=0.002), well-differentiated (OR 2.46, P<0.001), with intact tumour capsule (OR\n2.54, P=0.02), areas of microtrabecular (OR 4.32, P<0.001) and pseudoglandular (OR\n3.27, P<0.001) histological patterns, tumour cholestasis (OR 6.53, P<0.001), and alack of\ninflammatory infiltrates (OR 3.41, P<0.001) (Table 2 and Figure 1A-C). There were no\nassociations of CTNNB1 mutations with the degree of intra-tumor â€œheterogeneity\n(median number of architectural patterns/cytological variants per tumor: CTNNB1\nmutated 4 vs CTNNB1 non mutated 4). As expected, elevated mRNA levels of Wnt/B-\ncatenin pathway targets and surrogate immunohistochemical markers of its activation\n(B-catenin nuclear staining and high GS expression) were also associated with CTNNB1\nmutations (P<0.001) (Supplemental Table 3 and Figure 1A, 1D,and 1E). Consistent with\nthe observed lack of inflammatory infiltrates in CTNNB1 mutated HCC, these tumours\nalso exhibited downregulation of the IL6/JAK/STAT pathway, with low IL6, CRP and\nSAA2 mRNA levels and low CRP immunohistochemical expression (P<0.001) (Figure 1A\net 1E). Lack of ARID1A immunohistochemical expression was also frequently observed\n(Figure 1A).\n"

Interestingly, a major\nderegulation in bile salts transporters expression (up-regulation of transporters\ninvolved in canalicular bile Salts efflux and down-regulation of those responsible for bile\nsalts efflux into blood,flow),was observed and may contribute to the cholestatic\nphenotype of these tumours (Figure 1E and 1F).\n"
